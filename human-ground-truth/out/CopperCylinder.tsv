Adam recounts his voyage on the ship Trevelyan, his encounter with Desolation Island, and his ill-fated decision to go ashore with the second mate, Agnew. They become trapped with cannibalistic creatures and Adam manages to escape, eventually drifting on a boat and encountering a sea monster. He wakes up in a beautiful landscape and reaches the South Pole, where he encounters a group of gentle men and is taken to a city built on a mountain. Back with the friends, they discuss the manuscript's authenticity and its details, including Adam's experiences with an underground civilization and his love for a young woman named Almah. Adam witnesses horrifying rituals and struggles with his feelings towards the people. He learns of their plan to sacrifice him and Almah, leading to a disagreement with the Kohen about the value of life and death. In a society called the Kosekin, darkness and death are revered, and the wealthy are seen as a curse while paupers are envied. Attempts at wealth redistribution have been suppressed, resulting in a society where suffering from want is rare and self-denial is valued. Death and suffering are celebrated as ultimate blessings, and defeat in battle is embraced as a source of joy and honor. A group of friends discuss a manuscript describing extinct creatures and engage in lighthearted banter and debate about the language and origins of the Kosekin people. A group of individuals read a manuscript about the Troglodytes, cave-dwellers with a unique relationship with death. As they discuss the manuscript's authenticity and the fate of Adam and Almah, it becomes clear that Adam is deeply in love with Almah and willing to sacrifice everything for her. Adam and Almah embark on a journey with the Kosekin, facing a stormy sea and the anticipation of death. The Kosekin revel in danger and rejoice at the prospect of dying, but their celebration is cut short when the storm passes. Adam and Almah find solace in their escape and arrive at a bustling city. There, Adam meets the Kohen Gadol and his daughter Layelah, who hold radical views about wealth, love, and power. Layelah expresses her love for Adam and proposes that he marry her instead of Almah, causing Adam to feel conflicted. Layelah offers to save Adam's life and escape with him, but it remains uncertain if Almah can be saved as well. Layelah reveals a means of escape using a tame athaleb, a flying creature, and proposes a plan to reach a land called Magones before continuing to the land of the Orin. Adam is torn between his feelings for Layelah and his love for Almah. Adam and Almah plan their escape with Layelah's help, despite Layelah's persistent advances towards Adam, and they gather their belongings and set off on their journey.	965	sentence

A group of friends discuss a manuscript describing extinct creatures and engage in lighthearted banter and debate about the language and origins of the Kosekin people. A group of individuals read a manuscript about the Troglodytes, cave-dwellers with a unique relationship with death. As they discuss the manuscript's authenticity and the fate of Adam and Almah, it becomes clear that Adam is deeply in love with Almah and willing to sacrifice everything for her. Adam and Almah embark on a journey with the Kosekin, facing a stormy sea and the anticipation of death. The Kosekin revel in danger and rejoice at the prospect of dying, but their celebration is cut short when the storm passes. Adam and Almah find solace in their escape and arrive at a bustling city. There, Adam meets the Kohen Gadol and his daughter Layelah, who hold radical views about wealth, love, and power. Layelah expresses her love for Adam and proposes that he marry her instead of Almah, causing Adam to feel conflicted. Layelah offers to save Adam's life and escape with him, but it remains uncertain if Almah can be saved as well. Layelah reveals a means of escape using a tame athaleb, a flying creature, and proposes a plan to reach a land called Magones before continuing to the land of the Orin. Adam is torn between his feelings for Layelah and his love for Almah. Adam and Almah plan their escape with Layelah's help, despite Layelah's persistent advances towards Adam, and they gather their belongings and set off on their journey. Adam successfully harnesses an athaleb, a flying creature, with the help of an obliging Kosekin man, and prepares to embark on a flight with Almah. Adam and Almah successfully take flight on the athaleb, but they soon realize they are being pursued by another monster and prepare to fight rather than surrender. After successfully evading a pursuing monster, Adam and Almah arrive at the Island of Fire, a desolate and horrifying land, where they find themselves in complete darkness and struggle to find food for their athaleb. Adam and Almah search for food on a desolate island, get separated, and eventually reunite before continuing their journey on the athaleb. Adam and Almah find the carcass of a monstrous sea creature, use its body to cook fish, and continue their journey along the desolate beach. Adam and Almah, exhausted and unsure of where to go next, are suddenly surrounded by armed Kosekin, with Almah taken prisoner and Layelah appearing triumphant. Adam and Almah are confronted by Layelah, who offers them the choice between death on Magones or returning to the amir where they will be separated and face a more terrible fate. Layelah tries to convince Adam to abandon Almah and escape with her to the land of the Orin, where they can live in the light and love life, but Adam refuses, determined to stay by Almah's side and face death with her.	929	sentence

They find a package containing a plea for help from a man named Adam More, who is stranded in the Antarctic Ocean. While hunting seals, Lord Featherstone and Agnew get caught in a snowstorm and are left stranded on the ice. They drift aimlessly, encountering erupting volcanoes and a lifeless body. They eventually land on a shore and are greeted by repulsive native creatures who lead them to a cave. Lord Featherstone becomes suspicious when he witnesses a dead body and a nightmare hag with a knife. Lord Featherstone witnesses horrifying scenes and desperately tries to escape from repulsive native creatures who have trapped him and Agnew in a cave. The narrator, after being pursued and losing Agnew, drifts helplessly in a boat, resigned to his impending death. As he contemplates his fate, he experiences moments of hope and fear, eventually being miraculously delivered to the Antarctic pole. There, he discovers a beautiful world but faces the dilemma of venturing among strange, civilized people or risking starvation. Eventually, he is rescued by a group of kind strangers and transported to a city built on a mountain, where he observes peculiar races and engages in discussions about the authenticity of a mysterious manuscript. The narrator, accompanied by a skeptical friend, discovers a hidden underground city inhabited by a unique race of people who prefer darkness. He becomes enamored with a young maiden who stands out with her beauty and love for light. As he explores the city with a mysterious woman named Almah, he becomes increasingly curious about her duties and the dark fate that binds her. They encounter dangerous creatures and witness brutal rituals, causing the narrator to question the nature of the underground city and contemplate whether to stay or return. Amidst the duality of the gentle yet bloodthirsty nature of the people, the narrator finds solace in music. The narrator, who plays music for an underground race, becomes increasingly troubled by their dual nature and fears the upcoming Feast of Darkness. Against Almah's warnings, the narrator attends the feast and witnesses a horrifying sight. After waking up with Almah by their side, the narrator contemplates the kindness of the people despite the horrors witnessed. The narrator confesses their love for Almah and learns that their love means they are destined for a sacrificial fate. They plead with the Kohen for help but cannot comprehend each other's views on life, death, and love. The narrator realizes the futility of seeking help from someone who embraces death and poverty and learns more about the Kosekin people's customs and beliefs. The Kosekin people have a unique society where poverty is considered a blessing and wealth is seen as a curse, and they have peculiar laws and customs that punish the bestowers of wealth, treat criminals with splendor, and celebrate defeat in battles. The narrator learns about the social structure, economy, and beliefs of the Kosekin people, who value obedience over command, work for the benefit of others, and have a unique view of death and darkness as a blissful state, while Featherstone and the doctor discuss the creatures and possible existence of extinct animals in the narrator's manuscript. The characters discuss the existence and characteristics of various extinct animals in the narrator's manuscript, focusing on the opkuk, which resembles a magnified dodo bird, and the opmahera, which could be similar to the fossil bird of Massachusetts, the Gastornis parisiensis, or the Dinornis gigantea. The doctor and Lord Featherstone discuss the extinct animals mentioned in Adam More's manuscript, including the dinornis, ichthyosaurus, cheirotherium, teleosaurus, hyloeosaurus, plesiosaurus, iguanodon, and megalosaurus. Oxenden and the doctor engage in a debate about the origins of the underground race, discussing their physical characteristics, language, and the application of Grimm's Law to show a potential connection between the Kosekin language and Hebrew. Oxenden argues that the Kosekin people are the lost Ten Tribes and presents evidence linking their language and cave-dwelling habits to Semitic origins, while Melick humorously suggests that Shem from Noah's ark left some of his children there to colonize the South Pole. Oxenden and Almah face their impending sacrificial fate as they embark on a galley with the Kohen, surrounded by a dark and reverent city, while the Kohen discusses the Kosekin's view on death and their customs of honoring those who cause the death of others. As the narrator and Almah sail through a storm, they witness a scene of joy and peace among the Kosekin rowers, despite the imminent destruction of their ship. The narrator and Almah survive a storm at sea and arrive at a large harbor in a city that resembles the one they left, but is larger and more populous, filled with ships and boats of various kinds. The narrator and Almah are taken to the city of the Kosekin, where they are separated but allowed to remain in close proximity to each other, and the narrator is visited by the lowest man in the land, the Kohen Gadol, who regards them with curiosity.	887	sentence

During the regatta, they discover a mysterious metal can covered in slime and barnacles. Inside the can, they find packages containing sheets of writing in multiple languages, revealing a message from an Englishman trapped in an impossible-to-escape land. Adam More recounts his journey as the mate of a ship, Trevelyan, which becomes becalmed in the Antarctic Ocean and eventually drifts close to a desolate and icy promontory. Adam and the second mate, Agnew, decide to go ashore to hunt seals, but they get stranded on the icy promontory. They brave a dangerous snowstorm and row through rough seas back to their drifting ship, fearing they may have been abandoned. After being becalmed and losing sight of their ship, they row through a snowstorm, endure extreme cold and exhaustion, and find themselves drifting southward on the ice. They face the threat of encroaching ice and uncertain prospects of survival. They continue drifting towards volcanic islands, encountering a barren and inhospitable land and a dead sailor's letter pleading for him to return home. They bury the dead sailor, find evidence of a lost boat, and decide to continue drifting in the hope of finding an escape, despite the increasingly dangerous conditions. They realize they are headed towards the South Pole and encounter a desolate and forbidding land. They spot human figures on the opposite shore, but when they land on the desolate promontory, they are approached by repulsive and emaciated natives. The natives show no fear or hostility, offering gestures of respect and peace, which confuses and horrifies Adam. However, Agnew embraces their presence and tries to make friends with them. Adam witnesses a horrifying act of cannibalism, causing him to flee from the cave and be pursued by the natives. Adam witnesses the repulsive savages and their cannibalistic practices, realizes that Agnew has been attacked and likely killed, and desperately tries to escape their pursuit. After witnessing the death of his friend and escaping from the cannibalistic natives, Adam finds himself drifting helplessly in a boat through a narrow and treacherous channel, preparing himself for inevitable death as he is engulfed in darkness and uncertainty. As Adam continues to drift in darkness and uncertainty, he contemplates the possibility of being carried into a vast subterranean cavern, fueled by the theory of water flowing through the earth's poles, and wonders if he will ultimately be plunged into an unutterable abyss or emerge into a land of ice and eternal night. As Adam drifts in darkness, he contemplates the possibility of being carried into a vast subterranean cavern, and then he encounters a tremendous sea monster that attacks his boat. After a terrifying encounter with a sea monster, Adam More falls into a deep sleep and awakens to find himself surrounded by a beautiful and vibrant new world with mountains, lush vegetation, signs of human life, and a vast expanse of blue water. After drifting through treacherous waters and encountering a sea monster, Adam finds himself in a new world with a vast expanse of water, signs of human life, and a tropical climate, but now he faces the challenge of finding food to satisfy his hunger. Adam More decides to take the risk and venture among the people of the new world, signaling a galley and being taken in tow by the gentle and curious inhabitants who show him kindness and lead him into a cabin where he awaits what lies ahead. After being taken care of and served food and drink by the inhabitants of the new world, Adam More is led outside and finds himself in a land with buildings, walls, trees, and giant ferns, and is then introduced to three birds of gigantic stature that are harnessed to cars and used for transportation. Adam More finds himself in a vibrant and beautiful new world with lush vegetation, pavilions, and pyramidal-roofed structures, inhabited by a peculiar race of people who shun the sunlight and seek darkness, leading him to a central cavern where he is interrupted from reading the manuscript by the announcement of dinner. The group debates the authenticity of the manuscript, with Melick believing it to be a transparent hoax while the doctor presents evidence suggesting otherwise, such as the use of actual papyrus and the mechanical skill displayed in the writing material.	977	HI

After being becalmed and losing sight of their ship, they row through a snowstorm, endure extreme cold and exhaustion, and find themselves drifting southward on the ice. They face the threat of encroaching ice and uncertain prospects of survival. They continue drifting towards volcanic islands, encountering a barren and inhospitable land and a dead sailor's letter pleading for him to return home. They bury the dead sailor, find evidence of a lost boat, and decide to continue drifting in the hope of finding an escape, despite the increasingly dangerous conditions.

Adam More recounts his journey as the mate of a ship, becoming stranded on an icy promontory. He and the second mate, Agnew, endure extreme cold and exhaustion, drifting southward on the ice. They encounter a barren and inhospitable land, witnessing horrifying acts of cannibalism by the natives. Adam escapes and wakes up in a vibrant new world, where he encounters a peculiar race of people who shun sunlight. As he explores this underground world, he forms a connection with a young maiden named Almah and witnesses the natives' cruel practices. Adam decides to stay and help Almah, engaging in battles against monstrous creatures and bringing solace to the people with his music. However, he becomes increasingly fearful of his fate in a land of kind-hearted yet bloodthirsty cruelty. Almah warns Adam against attending a feast that marks the arrival of a new season, expressing her despair and hatred for their dark world. Despite the warning, Adam attends and witnesses a horrifying sight, leaving him despondent. After Almah recovers from illness, they discuss their love and the horrifying fate that awaits them. Adam appeals for help, but the Kohen sees death as a blessing and riches as a curse. They discuss the perverse values of the Kosekin society, where death is honored and love leads to self-surrender. The society values poverty, self-denial, and death, with the wealthy class striving to give away wealth and the working class pushing the burden onto the rich. The group discusses various theories about the existence and characteristics of extinct birds and prehistoric monsters, ultimately identifying the Plesiosaurus as the creature that fought with the galley. The group discusses various prehistoric creatures, including the plesiosaurus, iguanodon, and megalosaurus, and debates the origins of the underground people they have encountered. Oxenden argues that the language of the underground people is similar to Hebrew, suggesting they may be a Semitic people, while the other members of the group engage in playful banter and skepticism. Oxenden explains to the group that the underground people they have encountered share similarities with the Troglodytes, a Semitic people who lived in caves and had peculiar customs, including a strange relationship with death, leading to a debate about how these people could have reached the South Pole. Adam and Almah prepare to embark on a galley as they face their inevitable fate of public sacrifice, while the Kohen discusses the perverse values of the Kosekin society and tries to convince Adam that death and self-surrender are the ultimate forms of love and happiness. Adam and Almah stand together on the ship, observing the constellations and experiencing a magnificent aurora display, while the Kosekin crew rejoices in the face of an impending storm and impending death, seeing it as a release from the burdens of life. Adam and Almah survive a storm on the indestructible galley and reach a bustling city where they are separated by the Kosekin, causing Adam to plead for them to stay together. Adam and Almah are taken to a vast underground city where they are separated but assured that they will not be subject to the law of separation, and Adam meets the Kohen Gadol and his daughter Layelah, hoping to find in them selfishness and cowardice to aid in their escape. Adam More engages in conversations with the Kohen Gadol and Layelah, who are curious about his homeland and express unconventional ideas that challenge the values of the Kosekin society. Adam More forms a connection with Layelah, the daughter of the Kohen Gadol, who shares his radical views and ambitions to revolutionize the Kosekin society and introduce a new order of values based on selfishness, power, and luxury, while Layelah sees Adam as a divine teacher who can guide her in achieving her grand designs. Layelah tries to convince Adam that Almah should give him up and follow the customs of the Kosekin, while expressing her own willingness to be with Adam. Layelah confesses her love for Adam and tries to convince him to marry her instead of Almah, leading to a tense and confusing moment for Adam as he tries to navigate his feelings and loyalty.	874	sentence

Adam More recounts his journey as the mate of a ship, becoming stranded on an icy promontory. He and the second mate, Agnew, endure extreme cold and exhaustion, drifting southward on the ice. They encounter a barren and inhospitable land, witnessing horrifying acts of cannibalism by the natives. Adam escapes and wakes up in a vibrant new world, where he encounters a peculiar race of people who shun sunlight. As he explores this underground world, he forms a connection with a young maiden named Almah and witnesses the natives' cruel practices. Adam decides to stay and help Almah, engaging in battles against monstrous creatures and bringing solace to the people with his music. However, he becomes increasingly fearful of his fate in a land of kind-hearted yet bloodthirsty cruelty. Almah warns Adam against attending a feast that marks the arrival of a new season, expressing her despair and hatred for their dark world. Despite the warning, Adam attends and witnesses a horrifying sight, leaving him despondent. After Almah recovers from illness, they discuss their love and the horrifying fate that awaits them. Adam appeals for help, but the Kohen sees death as a blessing and riches as a curse. They discuss the perverse values of the Kosekin society, where death is honored and love leads to self-surrender. The society values poverty, self-denial, and death, with the wealthy class striving to give away wealth and the working class pushing the burden onto the rich. The group discusses theories about extinct birds and prehistoric monsters, identifying the Plesiosaurus as the creature that fought with the galley. They also debate the origins of the underground people they have encountered. Oxenden suggests that they may be a Semitic people, similar to the Troglodytes. Adam and Almah face public sacrifice but survive a storm on a galley and reach a bustling city. They are separated but assured they won't be subject to the law of separation. Adam forms a connection with Layelah, the daughter of the Kohen Gadol, who shares his radical views and ambitions to revolutionize the Kosekin society. Layelah tries to convince Adam to marry her instead of Almah, leading to a confusing discussion about marrying both women. Layelah offers to save Adam from the impending sacrifice, but he insists on staying with Almah; Layelah reveals her plan for escape and leads Adam to a dark cavern where they encounter mysterious living beings. Layelah introduces Adam to an enormous, winged creature called an athaleb, which can be ridden and flown using a harness, and she demonstrates how to guide the athaleb through the air. Layelah explains to Adam the plan of using the athaleb to escape to a land called the Orin, where people love light and life, but Adam considers the possibility of using the athaleb to fly with Almah instead. Layelah tries to convince Adam to fly with her using the athaleb, but he remains loyal to Almah and reveals their plan to escape the sacrificial fate that awaits them in the Kosekin society. Adam and Almah navigate through the cavern of the athalebs with the help of a friendly Epet, who demonstrates how to rouse and guide the monstrous creatures. Adam and Almah harness the athaleb, a monstrous winged creature, and successfully fly away from the city, soaring above the sea and marveling at the breathtaking sights below. Adam and Almah soar through the air on their athaleb, witnessing the beauty of the night sky and the darkness of the water below, but their peaceful flight is interrupted when they are pursued by another monster; they manage to scare it away and continue their journey until they reach the Island of Fire, a desolate and terrifying land of lava, fire, and destruction. Adam searches for food and water in the desolate land, but becomes separated from Almah and must rely on the athaleb to guide him to safety.	874	sentence

Adam escapes and wakes up in a vibrant underground world, where he forms a connection with a young woman named Almah. As they navigate this new world, they witness the natives' cruel practices and engage in battles against monstrous creatures. However, their peaceful flight is interrupted by a monster, and they are eventually captured by the Kosekin. After shooting down a monstrous creature called the athaleb, Adam rescues Layelah from drowning and they find themselves floating on its back. They end up stranded on an island after escaping the underground world, uncertain of what lies ahead. They are eventually rescued by the athalebs and reunited with Almah. However, their joy is short-lived as they witness a remarkable sight in the sky. The group discusses various theories and speculations, while Adam and Almah endure imprisonment and separation, ultimately facing the dreaded Mista Kosek. Despite their brief moment of joy, their fate remains uncertain. Adam and Almah are forcibly separated in a dark ceremony, believing it would save their lives, but they later learn that their separation was merely a symbol and they are still destined to be sacrificed. On the day of sacrifice, Adam prepares to fight for his life and witnesses the solemn ceremonies and sacrifices of the Kosekin, as he anxiously awaits his fate and hopes for a chance to be reunited with Almah. Adam, witnessing Almah about to be sacrificed, shoots the nightmare hag and rescues Almah, leading to a chaotic scene where the crowd turns against them, but Adam defends Almah and prepares to fight for their lives. As the crowd approaches, Adam seizes the opportunity to use their belief in his divinity to his advantage, proclaiming himself as Atam-or, the Man of Light, and the Father of Thunder, in an attempt to save himself and Almah from certain death.	967	sentence

As they embark on a galley to their public death, Adam and Almah embrace their love for each other and discuss the transformative power of love, while observing the constellations in the sky. The group on the galley experiences a storm, during which the Kosekin crew rejoices in the face of death while the narrator and Almah remain calm; however, the storm passes without causing harm and the crew's mood turns gloomy, except for the narrator and Almah who are relieved, and they continue their journey through the sea encountering other ships. The narrator and Almah arrive at a bustling city in the underground civilization, where they are separated but eventually allowed to stay together, and they are led to a vast cavern with twinkling lights and enormous columns. Adam More, the narrator, is visited by the Kohen Gadol and his daughter Layelah, who express curiosity about his origins and the world beyond the mountains, revealing a desire to know about a life that values light, life, and self-interest.	889	sentence

Oxenden and Melick engage in a debate about the authenticity of the manuscript, while the doctor explains the nature of the athaleb, a creature similar to a pterodactyl, and its significance in connecting the Kosekin to the Semitic race. Oxenden explains the connection between the Hebrew and Kosekin alphabets, using Grimm's Law as evidence, while the doctor discusses the nature of Magones as a volcanic island and explains the formation of coral islands by tiny zoophytes.	904	sentence
