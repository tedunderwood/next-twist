Meanwhile, in another town, attorney David Crosby is involved in the trial of Lindell Trent, accused of theft. After Lindell is found guilty, Zelina Miles confesses to falsely accusing her. Lindell is released from prison and leaves for Australia with a new identity. David, determined to find her, discusses his plans with Enos Melford. David Crosby, a renowned defense attorney, is hired by Archibald Chalmers, who is accused of murdering Rupert van Slyke. Chalmers offers Crosby indefinite use of his uncle's yacht if he successfully defends him and prevents him from testifying. As the trial unfolds, Crosby questions witnesses and exposes questionable actions by detectives. He also discovers a mysterious veiled woman in the courtroom. Through his strategic questioning and investigation, Crosby aims to prove Chalmers' innocence and uncover the truth behind the murder. Crosby questions Carrington about his motive for reporting Chalmers and presents arguments to break down his story. Handwriting experts confirm the authenticity of Chalmers' signature on the subscription booklet. During a break in the trial, Chalmers asks Crosby to come to the jail immediately. Crosby travels to Omaha and learns about a codicil in Chalmers' uncle's will that requires his acquittal for him to inherit the estate. In court, various witnesses testify, including Hickey about threats made by van Slyke, Ballmeier about taxicabs, Lipke about the sale of Chalmers' car, and Griswold about travel time. Queed confirms the authenticity of Chalmers' signature, and Okerburg and Morely provide alibis for Chalmers. Ballmeier tries to discredit Morely's testimony but fails, and Okerburg fearlessly answers questions. The prosecutor presents evidence against Archibald Chalmers, including witnesses and the discovery of his stickpin at the crime scene. Crosby delivers a persuasive speech in court, dismissing the evidence and emphasizing Chalmers' innocence. The jury fails to reach a verdict, leading to a retrial. Chalmers proposes a plan to discredit a witness, and Crosby agrees to help. Meanwhile, Eric Worman, a bank cashier, steals money and valuable gems and flees to St. Paul. Anne faces financial troubles when she receives an unsigned cheque. Anne, disguised as a young man, meets an Irish man named Mike and they receive blue cheques at a tent show. They plan to cash them but encounter a congested street-car line. Meanwhile, Viggman panics after hearing about a murder in St. Paul and is taken to be interrogated. In court, Red Bronson testifies about Archibald Chalmers' plan to burglarize a safe, shocking Crosby. As tension rises, a new witness is called, and David Crosby is arrested for grand larceny. David Crosby receives a letter from Archibald Chalmers, who confesses to committing a crime to prevent a witness from testifying against him. Chalmers offers Crosby a large sum of money to handle the situation. As Crosby faces potential arrest and extradition, he learns about a scheme orchestrated by Al Lipke to kidnap John Carrington and secure Chalmers' innocence. With the help of various individuals, including Anne Wentworth and Lindell Trent, Crosby uncovers important information that could prove Chalmers' innocence in a murder case. He confronts Lipke and demands Carrington's release before midnight. Crosby calls Edward Venson to the stand, who testifies about the events surrounding Rupert van Slyke's murder. Venson identifies the red-haired man as the one who grappled with him. Crosby then calls Professor Percival L. Brown, an expert on piracy, to testify about Captain William Kidd's character and actions. Crosby presents a colored reproduction of a painting to the jury, depicting Captain Josiah Quarlbush and Professor Brown provides information about Quarlbush's history with Captain Kidd. Crosby questions Mr. Venson about his knowledge of Rupert van Slyke's ancestry and the authenticity of the Kidd log-book story, ultimately revealing that Venson fabricated the story to secure a job with van Slyke. During the cross-examination, Crosby questions Venson about his knowledge of pirate novels and the red hair of the murderer, and Venson demonstrates how he grappled with the fleeing man. David Crosby reveals that the stickpin identified by Venson as belonging to Archibald Chalmers is actually a different pin, exposing Venson as a liar and unveiling his true identity as Jordan Jones, a double of Chalmers who was in the hospital at the time of the murder. Edward Venson, the witness in the Chalmers murder trial, panics and proclaims his innocence, revealing a letter that he claims will prove he did not commit the murder. He then requests a hammer and chisel and proceeds to forcefully break open a large safe in the courtroom. The witness, after using a hammer and chisel to break open a safe in the courtroom, reveals a hidden recess containing an ancient flintlock pistol, a roll of parchment, and a shrunken, preserved human hand. Judge Lockhart examines the documents and announces that the trial will likely end with an acquittal for the defendant, as the evidence suggests that Captain Josiah Quarlbush, a mortal enemy of Captain Kidd, is responsible for the murder of Rupert van Slyke. Three individuals arrive at Leslie van Slyke's residence and engage in a conversation about the Chinese safe that was returned to him after the trial. David Crosby explains to Leslie van Slyke how he came to suspect Edward Venson and reveals the sequence of events leading up to Rupert van Slyke's death. Venson discovers a secret repository inside a wooden vault where Rupert had stored gold liberty bonds, and as he tries to open it, a bullet is fired, killing Rupert. Leslie van Slyke learns about the secret recess in the Cheng safe and David Crosby reveals a typewritten sheet of parchment roll found inside the safe, detailing Josiah Quarlbush's connection to Captain Kidd and his plan to seek revenge.
