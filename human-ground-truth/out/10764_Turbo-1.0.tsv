Catherine, the queen, is horrified when she sees Lady Castlemaine's name on the list of her attendants and confronts Charles, expressing her objections. Charles tries to convince Catherine to accept Lady Castlemaine, but she refuses. Catherine grows distant from Charles and faints when he brings Lady Castlemaine into her presence. Meanwhile, Amber, a performer, reunites with the Earl of Almsbury, but explains she cannot pursue a relationship due to her current partner, Rex Morgan. Amber faces humiliation and seeks revenge against Barbara Palmer, while also dealing with a pregnancy and her ambitions for a more exciting life. Amber is surprised by the arrival of Lord Almsbury and Bruce Carlton while she is bathing. She is reunited with Lord Carlton and they express their love for each other. They visit Amber's son, Bruce, and then leave the cottage. Amber and Bruce become attracted to each other and plan their next move at an inn. Amber prepares for Lord Carlton's arrival at the theater but becomes jealous when she sees him with Lady Castlemaine. Bruce introduces Amber to a young boy named Tansy. Amber tries to divert attention away from the connection between Lord Carlton and Rex Morgan. Lord and Lady Almsbury suggest leaving and Amber makes plans to meet Lord Carlton the next morning. Amber convinces Bruce to help her deceive Rex and they leave London together. They enjoy a week-long stay at an inn before Bruce's departure. Rex confronts Amber and threatens her, then challenges Lord Carlton to a duel. Amber pleads with Rex not to fight, but he remains determined. The duel begins and Bruce wounds Rex, who eventually dies from his injuries. Amber seeks advice from Dr. Heydon about her relationship with the King. Barbara is ecstatic when Dr. Heydon tells her that the Queen's child will be born dead and gives him her jewels as a reward. However, while Barbara keeps a close watch on the Queen's health, Catherine appears to be thriving. Catherine expresses her anguish to Charles about not being able to give him a son, and he reassures her, comforting her as she falls asleep. Charles is devoted to her during her illness, but the court is already speculating on who he will marry next. Barbara, concerned about the Queen's deteriorating health, fears that her rival Frances might win the King's affections. Charles, deeply worried, visits Catherine as she lies near death, expressing regret for his selfishness and promising a better future. After Rex Morgan's death, Amber mourns his absence and reflects on how his presence brought her warmth, happiness, and a sense of security, while also recognizing the shallowness of the men in her current circle. Amber, disappointed that she has not found another man to support her, contemplates a life of being a famous and envied exclusive harlot, despite her earlier reservations about matrimony. Amber is seen with three younger sons who live above their means and engage in a frivolous lifestyle, attracting attention from others, including the Duke of Buckingham. The Duke of Buckingham invites Amber to join him for supper at Long's, a fashionable ordinary in the Haymarket, after admiring her beauty. They arrive and enjoy a private room and supper while the Duke shares his dissatisfaction with the state of England.

Corinna confronts Bruce about his affair with the Duchess of Ravenspur and expresses her feelings of hurt and insecurity. Amber arrives at Lord Carlton's stationer's shop, excited to see him and convince him that he is wrong about her, and she enters the shop to find him examining a manuscript without noticing her. Bruce tells Amber that he cannot continue their relationship because he is married to Corinna and plans to leave London for good. Bruce brings a picture-book for Susanna to amuse herself while Amber gets dressed and they exchange smiles over a private joke, but Susanna asks about the devil's horns and a cuckold, prompting Amber to redirect her and change the topic. Amber moves into Ravenspur House and takes Bruce on a tour, proudly showing off its luxurious features and her fabulous collection of silver and gold. Bruce raises concerns about her investments and suggests saving money for the future, which alarms Amber and makes her look at herself in the mirror with a mix of fear and denial, but Nan reassures her that she has never been more beautiful. A grand and lively party takes place, with music, dancing, and gambling. Amber orchestrates a scheme to humiliate Lady Castlemaine by having a harlot wear an exact replica of her gown. Despite Barbara's anger, the King finds it amusing and does nothing to punish the imposter.
