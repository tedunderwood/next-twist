Viggman is captured by two men and taken to St. Paul, where he is brought to a room and brutally beaten by a big man who demands information about stolen goods. Two witnesses in a trial have managed to fabricate a story that aligns perfectly, but the prosecutor suspects they are hiding a crucial fact. He presents telegrams as evidence that the key witness has disappeared, suggesting a conspiracy and possibly even murder. Red Bronson, a witness in Archibald Chalmers' murder trial, testifies that he met Chalmers in Chicago and was propositioned to help him create an alibi for a personal job in high society. Bronson explains to the court how Archibald Chalmers wore a rubber face mask every night to tighten the muscles on one side of his face, and how Chalmers devised a plan to break into a Chinese safe belonging to a man named van Slyke. Two men place an antique safe on display in the courtroom, and Red Bronson demonstrates how the defendant, Archibald Chalmers, described the safe's mechanism to him.
