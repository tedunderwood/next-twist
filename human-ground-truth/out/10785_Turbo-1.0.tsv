As the investigation into O'Connell's murder continues, Breck's interactions with Miss Smith and Aunt Megruesome become more significant. Breckenridge Barnum, a writer, is caught off guard when his manuscript is stolen from his apartment. He is then confronted by a tall, golden-blonde girl holding a pistol, demanding to know where it is. Breck denies any knowledge of the manuscript and recounts the events leading up to its theft. Detective Burke, Aunt Megruesome, and T. Colman Flanders join the investigation and discuss the stolen manuscript with Breck. Concerned about the murders and mobsters, Breck decides to help Dorothy, who is in danger. However, when he enters her hotel room, he finds her wounded and a mysterious presence in the room. He grabs a gun and takes Miss Smith to a safe place to discuss the recent events. Miss Smith confronts Breck about his strange behavior and demands an explanation for leaving Dorothy's dead body and bringing her to a safe place. Breck reveals that he has figured out Miss Smith's true identity as Mara Flanders, the granddaughter of Old Tom Flanders. Mara recounts her background to Breck, explaining how her uncle took most of the family's wealth after her grandfather's death. She reveals that her grandfather had important information regarding a lost bequest, and Breck had made a copy of the document. Mara also explains how she followed the criminals to a hotel, discovered a dead body, and got trapped in the darkness until Breck rescued her. Despite their escape, they are caught by the police, and further interrogations and accusations follow. Miss Flanders, Breck, Amy, Lou, Sandra, and Detective Burke are confronted about their involvement in various crimes and tensions begin to fade as surprising familial connections are revealed.

Sandra Tremaine informs Mara Flanders and Breckenridge Barnum that the missing information might be in the final private statement Bryan O'Connell issued to the family before he died. Breck and his companions, including Sandra Tremaine and Mara Flanders, go to a warehouse to retrieve Breck's stolen manuscript. After some difficulty, they find the manuscript in a green file among a clutter of old furniture and documents. They then adjourn to Breck's apartment, where Breck begins to read Tom Flanders' last words. Amy Brewster, Lieutenant Burke, and Breck discuss the mysterious document they found, while Amy enjoys a hearty meal and drinks gin. They realize it is a cryptogram and decide to have it deciphered by experts at the police headquarters. Sunny suggests that Mara call her by a different name, and Amy challenges Lieutenant Burke's ability to decipher the cryptogram, betting that they can do it themselves. Sunny discovers that the cipher puzzle is not a crypt but a straight cipher and deciphers the hidden message, revealing that they need to search the Long Beach foundations for something important to the Flanders family.
