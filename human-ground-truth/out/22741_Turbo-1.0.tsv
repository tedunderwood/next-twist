Baby Suggs helps Sethe recover after giving birth, attending to her physical needs and caring for the newborn baby. Baby Suggs attempts to comfort Sethe by softly caressing her neck but unexpectedly starts choking her until Denver and Beloved rush to help and Sethe realizes she has bruises on her neck. Sethe reflects on her past and her relationship with Paul D while walking with her daughters. She is determined to have Paul D in her life and plans to prepare a special meal for him. Sethe's attention towards Paul D causes Beloved to feel excluded and angry, leading to a confrontation, and Denver witnessing the incident. Denver's silence is broken when she hears the ghost of her dead sister crawling up the stairs, causing a shift in the dynamics of the people in the house and leading to deliberate abuse and the decline of Baby Suggs. Beloved spreads her skirt in the water while Paul D trembles nervously. He is then taken and imprisoned in a dark and crowded trench with other black men, bound by chains and subjected to abusive guards. The men, led by Hi Man, use a sledgehammer to break through and escape their confinement by singing and beating to the rhythm, rebelliously expressing their longing for freedom and their defiance of a life filled with hardship and oppression. Paul D joins a group of sick Cherokee who are living as fugitives. They wait for their next move, hoping to find a way to the North. Paul D finds himself sleeping in a rocking chair every night and eventually moves to Baby Suggs' bed in Sethe's house, feeling restless and uncomfortable in other sleeping arrangements. Beloved moves closer to Paul D as he trembles and says his name repeatedly, while Denver finds solace in being looked at by Beloved and refrains from asking her burning questions.
