chapterbooks/LeagesUnderGB.txt	Twenty Thousand Leagues	Jules Verne	prediction	As the Nautilus continues its journey through the Indian Ocean, the narrator and his companions encounter even more diverse and fascinating marine life, including unique fish species and underwater wonders, sparking their awe and curiosity.	66640	3132	0	74	774	The worldwide fascination and alarm caused by sightings of an enormous sea creature lead to debates among scholars and skeptics. Two maritime accidents provide evidence of its existence, causing widespread fear. Professor Aronnax, the narrator, joins an expedition to hunt down the mysterious creature in the northern Pacific Ocean. Despite doubts and setbacks, the crew of the frigate Abraham Lincoln eventually encounters the creature, but their attempts to catch it prove futile, leading to dangerous decisions and risks to their own safety. Despite their futile attempts to catch a sea creature, the crew's collision throws the narrator and Conseil overboard. They struggle to stay afloat until they are rescued by Ned Land, only to discover they are on a massive underwater steel boat. Captured by masked men, they are imprisoned until they encounter the ship's commander, who engages in a conversation about their identities and circumstances. The narrator and his companions are imprisoned on the Nautilus, a massive underwater steel boat commanded by Captain Nemo. Nemo offers them a chance to explore the underwater world and learn its secrets. The narrator explores Nemo's library and museum, filled with impressive collections of books, art, and marine exhibits. Nemo explains the Nautilus's advanced technology, including its propulsion system and use of electricity. The narrator questions Nemo about his collisions with other ships and ponders his mysterious background and motivations. They embark on a voyage under the water, witnessing the wonders of the sea. The narrator and his companions explore the underwater world aboard the Nautilus, marveling at the diversity and beauty of the marine life. They witness stunning sunrises, encounter strange creatures, and explore underwater forests. Captain Nemo challenges the narrator's beliefs and shares his vision of underwater towns. They also come across mysterious phenomena such as a motionless black mass and a sinking ship with corpses. Throughout their journey, they observe the wonders of the ocean, including coral formations and islands. The Nautilus, a submarine, voyages through the New Hebrides islands and arrives at Vanikoro, the location of a famous shipwreck. The narrator learns about the fate of the Count de La Pérouse's ill-fated expedition and explores the underwater wreckage. Captain Nemo reveals more information about the expedition and the Nautilus continues its journey through dangerous waterways in the Torres Strait and the Coral Sea. The submarine runs aground on a reef, but Captain Nemo remains confident. The narrator and his companions explore an island, gather provisions, and encounter various birds. They also hunt for food but are attacked by hostile natives. The Nautilus encounters a large group of natives, but no hostility is shown. The narrator and Conseil discover a rare shell, but it is destroyed by an islander. They have a tense encounter with a group of Papuans in canoes. Captain Nemo dismisses the narrator's concerns about the approaching Papuan natives, expressing confidence in the Nautilus's safety and revealing that the submarine will float off the next day at a specific time. Captain Nemo demonstrates the Nautilus's electrical defense system by shocking and repelling a group of hostile natives, and the Nautilus successfully breaks free from its coral bed and continues its journey at a remarkable speed. The Nautilus, under Captain Nemo's command, conducts experiments on sea temperatures and densities, providing the narrator with fascinating insights, and later the submarine enters a period of inactivity and darkness as repairs are made. The Nautilus drifts into a dazzling and vibrant area filled with luminous sea creatures, and Captain Nemo and the crew observe the spectacle before increasing the submarine's speed. Captain Nemo, in a fit of anger, orders the narrator and his companions to be confined, and they are drugged and put to sleep before waking up in a state of confusion and disorientation. The narrator is surprised to find himself back in his stateroom on the Nautilus and discovers a wounded crewman whom he tends to, leading to a conversation with Captain Nemo about the man's injuries and the events that led to them. The narrator and his companions, equipped with diving suits, embark on an underwater excursion with Captain Nemo and his crew, exploring the coral realm and marveling at the wondrous petrified forests and brightly colored coral formations. Captain Nemo and his crew bury a deceased companion in a coral cemetery on the ocean floor, leading to a discussion about death and the peacefulness of the underwater resting place. The narrator reflects on Captain Nemo's fierce defiance of human society and his own curiosity for the wonders of the underwater world, while contemplating the possibility of escape and the ethical dilemma of sacrificing his companions for his own pursuit of knowledge.	944	sentence

The Nautilus engages in a fierce battle with a herd of sperm whales, ultimately defeating them and leaving the sea covered in mutilated corpses. The Nautilus continues its voyage through icy waters, passing through floating icebergs and witnessing the stunning beauty of the Antarctic landscape. The Nautilus encounters treacherous ice fields and attempts to navigate through them, facing violent squalls and extreme cold, but ultimately gets held back by an immovable barrier known as the Ice Bank, leading Ned Land to question Captain Nemo's ability to overcome it. Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax discuss their predicament of being trapped by the Ice Bank, but Captain Nemo reveals his plan to continue the voyage to the Antarctic pole, using the Nautilus to navigate beneath the ice. Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax discuss their plan to reach the South Pole with the Nautilus, and preparations for the daring attempt are made as they navigate through the Ice Bank and continue their swift progress towards the pole.

After reaching the polar shore, Professor Aronnax and Captain Nemo observe the sun sinking below the horizon, confirming their arrival at the South Pole. Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax reach the South Pole aboard the Nautilus, where Captain Nemo claims the entire region as his own, unfurling a black flag with a gold ""N"" and bidding farewell to the sun before preparing for departure. The Nautilus, which had run aground on an iceberg, begins to right itself, with the crew feeling the ship return to a normal position.

Ned Land attempts to hunt a dugong, but the animal escapes, leading to a chase that ends with the dugong attacking the skiff and Ned Land ultimately killing it, resulting in a feast for the crew of the Nautilus. The Nautilus passes through the Arabian Tunnel, reaches the Suez Canal, and emerges in the Mediterranean Sea, where the narrator witnesses the sunrise and eagerly steps onto the platform.

Captain Nemo claims the South Pole as his own and unfurls a black flag with a gold ""N,"" but soon the Nautilus runs aground and lists to one side. The crew becomes trapped underwater, running out of air, and devises a plan to free the ship by cutting through the surrounding ice with boiling water.

The narrator and his companions explore the area, discovering Captain Nemo's treasure trove and discussing the moral implications of hoarding wealth. They plan their escape from the Nautilus. Later, Captain Nemo takes the narrator on a nighttime excursion into the depths of the ocean, where they encounter strange formations and marine life. They also explore the ruins of Atlantis, reflecting on the ancient civilization. The Nautilus then enters an extinct volcano, where they mine coal and continue their journey. They encounter various obstacles and wildlife as they explore the volcano, and later navigate through the Sargasso Sea. Finally, they continue their journey toward the Pacific South Seas. The narrator observes various marine creatures and encounters a whaling vessel while navigating with Captain Nemo on the Nautilus, and they conduct depth-sounding experiments to reach the lowest depths of the ocean. As the Nautilus sinks deeper into the ocean, the narrator observes various marine creatures and discusses the possibility of life at extreme depths with Captain Nemo, eventually leading to the proposition of taking photographs of the underwater region. The Nautilus captures a stunning photograph of the ocean floor before swiftly ascending to the surface, and the narrator, Ned, and Conseil discuss the limited number of people that could possibly be on board the Nautilus. Ned Land becomes excited when the Nautilus encounters a herd of baleen whales, reminiscing about his past as a whale fisherman and expressing frustration at being unable to hunt them while aboard the submarine. Ned Land becomes excited at the sight of a herd of southern right whales and asks Captain Nemo for permission to hunt them, but Captain Nemo refuses, stating that there is no need to kill them for the sake of killing. Captain Nemo and the crew of the Nautilus engage in a fierce battle with a herd of sperm whales, using the submarine as a weapon to attack and kill the whales. The Nautilus encounters a mass slaughter of sperm whales and the crew witnesses the aftermath, with Ned Land expressing his disapproval, while Captain Nemo demonstrates resourcefulness by collecting milk from a dead southern right whale; later, the Nautilus navigates through icebergs in the polar seas, with Captain Nemo observing the surroundings with interest. Captain Nemo skillfully navigates the Nautilus through treacherous ice fields in the Antarctic seas, carving a path with brute force and encountering violent squalls, as the narrator marvels at the beauty and dangers of the new region. The Nautilus becomes trapped in an immovable barrier of ice, known as the Ice Bank, and despite the captain's determination to go further, they are unable to proceed and are forced to consider turning back until Captain Nemo reveals his plan to navigate to the Antarctic pole, a feat never before achieved. Captain Nemo reveals his plan to navigate the Nautilus under the solidified ice at the South Pole, and the crew begins preparations for the daring attempt, including filling the air tanks and breaking free the ice surrounding the ship.	857	HI

While exploring an uninhabited island, the narrator, Ned, and Conseil find an abundance of edible vegetation, including breadfruit, which Ned cooks and shares with the others, leading to a discussion about the lack of a soup course.	891	sentence

The narrator and Captain Nemo find themselves trapped in the Ice Bank, but Captain Nemo reveals his audacious plan to take the Nautilus to the Antarctic pole, a feat that no one has ever accomplished. The Nautilus prepares to venture to the South Pole, with Captain Nemo addressing potential obstacles and the crew making necessary preparations. The Nautilus reaches the surface of the water, finding open sea and sparse icebergs, leading the narrator and Captain Nemo to explore a solitary islet near a considerable shore, possibly confirming Commander Maury's theories about the Antarctic Circle. Captain Nemo and the narrator arrive on the shore of the Antarctic, where they encounter volcanic terrain, limited vegetation, and abundant bird and marine life; however, their exploration is hindered by the absence of the sun, leaving them uncertain about whether they have reached the pole. The narrator and Conseil explore the Antarctic shores, observing a multitude of seals and walruses in their natural habitat. The narrator and Captain Nemo observe a group of walruses playing on a promontory in the Antarctic, but their exploration is disrupted by the absence of the sun, leaving them uncertain about their exact location and the impending arrival of the long polar night.	1013	sentence
