Strike realizes that his gun is missing and contemplates reporting the information about Darryl Adams anonymously to the Homicide, but decides to do it on Sunday when things are quieter. Rocco visits Victor in prison and prepares for an interview, aware that any mention of Strike could complicate the case. Rocco conducts an interview with Victor, assuring him that it will be non-incriminating, and tries to convince him that he believes Victor is innocent of the murder of Darryl Adams. Victor is being interviewed by Rocco and Jimmy, who suggest that Victor's brother gave him the gun and instructed him to turn himself in, but Victor insists that the shooting was in self-defense. Rocco confronts Victor in an interview, promising not to arrest his brother if he tells the truth about whether his brother killed Darryl Adams. Victor collects his belongings and leaves without answering. Strike spends the past twenty-four hours in Rodney's store, selling candy bars and sodas while anxiously waiting for the remaining three ounces of drugs to be unloaded. He then meets Jo-Jo to make a payment and questions him about any upcoming deals. Strike returns to Rodney's store after paying off Jo-Jo, only to find out that they still have another half ounce of drugs to unload. Rodney and Strike watch as a bartender retrieves the package Strike dropped, and Strike realizes they are out of drugs. Rodney is arrested and taken to the precinct, where he calls his girlfriend to pick up their son, but she doesn't show up. Rodney's son is then taken by a social worker, and Rodney is fingerprinted and given bail.
