Mr. O'Rorke explores the grandeur of Dalradern Castle, appraising its treasures and contemplating how much money he can extract from Sir Within's boundless wealth, until he stumbles upon a room filled with fruit and wine and is confronted by an unknown voice.

O'Rorke, having enjoyed a lavish meal and wine, finally meets with Ladarelle, who reveals his desire for his old relative to die, and O'Rorke, intrigued, agrees to serve Ladarelle's interests in exchange for compensation, while Ladarelle questions the authenticity of the letter O'Rorke delivered from Kate. Ladarelle and O'Rorke discuss Kate's letter to Sir Within, revealing her plea for help to free her innocent grandfather, and Ladarelle proposes a scheme to prevent Sir Within from marrying Kate and leaving her with a substantial inheritance. Ladarelle and O'Rorke discuss a plan to prevent Kate from regaining her influence over Sir Within by convincing her that he will not receive or read her letter, thus preventing her from writing to him again. Ladarelle and O'Rorke discuss their plan to prevent Kate from regaining influence over Sir Within by intercepting his response to her letter and potentially convincing her that he plans to marry someone else. Ladarelle and O'Rorke discuss their respective alliances and potential gains as they consider serving Sir Within or Ladarelle's interests, ultimately negotiating a deal that involves money, power, and the manipulation of Kate's relationship with Sir Within. Ladarelle gives O'Rorke his watch and Sir Within's letter, which reveals an order to pay Miss Luttrell two hundred pounds, leading them to plan to intercept Kate's letters and prevent her from regaining influence over Sir Within. Kate defies her uncle's orders and decides to go to Westport to meet O'Rorke and gather information about her grandfather's case, despite his anger and threats of cutting ties with her.	919	sentence

Meanwhile, Kate O'Hara decides to accept her uncle's offer and leaves Sir Within. She boards a steamboat to start a new chapter of her life with uncertainty. Kate arrives at the island of Arran, where she is met by Molly Ryan and they make their way to the Abbey. Kate, once living a life of luxury, reflects on her decision to leave it behind and finds solace in the simplicity of the island and its people. Embracing her new identity as an Arran islander, she strives to create a comfortable and elegant space for herself. However, her uncle regrets bringing her to this simple life. As Kate adapts to her new life, she encounters a man named O'Rorke who reveals the financial instability of her uncle and the need to help her grandfather escape to America.

Mr. M'Kinlay, a stranger to the island, confronts John Luttrell and expresses his grievances about his treacherous journey, prompting Luttrell to agree to discuss business matters with him. Mr. M'Kinlay visits John Luttrell on behalf of Sir Gervais Vyner, delivering a letter that explains the purpose of his visit, while Luttrell listens silently and stoically, displaying his proud and sensitive temperament. During a conversation with Mr. M'Kinlay, Luttrell expresses his reluctance to become a trustee and guardian for a young girl, citing his own history of failures and the potential disaster he believes his involvement would bring, but he is reminded of the importance of choosing a trustee and considers the fate of his own son, Harry, before making a decision. Luttrell agrees to let Vyner be the guardian of his son, Harry, and shares his decision with Mr. M'Kinlay, while Harry expresses his desire to go away with an American visitor who tells him stories of exotic lands and riches, leading Luttrell to reluctantly give his consent. Luttrell hosts a dinner in the sacristy of the Abbey, surprising his guests with the abundance of food and the warm atmosphere, while Harry stands near the table and Luttrell tries to hide his astonishment at the preparations; however, the arrival of the American tourist triggers a recognition in Mr. M'Kinlay, who realizes that the tourist is the same person who caused him shame during their previous encounter in Wales.	897	sentence

The American tourist surprises Luttrell by requesting to borrow his son. Luttrell encounters Mr. M'Kinlay, who delivers a letter from Sir Gervais Vyner. Luttrell reluctantly agrees to let Vyner be the guardian of his son. Luttrell hosts a dinner where Mr. M'Kinlay recognizes the American tourist as someone who caused him shame in the past.

As Luttrell's reputation is attacked and he becomes estranged from his wife, Vyner reflects on his descent into revolutionary politics and alcoholism. Meanwhile, Vyner's daughter Ada forms a connection with a troubled boy named Harry Luttrell. Amidst tensions between locals and tourists, secrets are revealed, relationships are tested, and the characters grapple with their own inner struggles and desires. Luttrell reluctantly agrees to let Vyner be the guardian of his son, while Kitty (formerly Kitty Malone) disguises herself as Ada and convinces her grandfather to let her stay with the Vyner family. Kate (formerly Kitty Malone) discovers she is being sent away, but Sir Within Wardle promises to help her and keep her secret. Sir Within Wardle and Mr. M'Kinlay discuss options for Kate O'Hara's future, including sending her to school in Paris. Kate and Ada discuss their impending separation, with Kate expressing resignation. Peter Malone eagerly awaits a letter from his granddaughter, Kate, but is disappointed when she expresses her independence and dismisses his help. Mr. M'Kinlay accompanies Ada to a villa in Genoa, where he is charmed by Miss Courtenay but faces disapproval when she learns of the plan to keep Kate at Dalradern Castle. Sir Gervais Vyner prepares for the arrival of his wealthy guests and decides to present Kate as his ward. Sir Within Wardle, the owner of Dalradern Castle, contemplates his social standing and the estate's financial troubles. He invites Mr. Grenfell to dinner to discuss returning the estate to Mr. Ladarelle in exchange for money. However, their negotiations become strained. Sir Within also introduces Mr. Grenfell to Kate, whose past is shrouded in mystery. Ladarelle becomes captivated by Grenfell's connections and seeks his approval. Meanwhile, Sir Within and Grenfell discuss potential marriage arrangements for Kate, and during a ride through the estate, Sir Within realizes his deepening feelings for her after she falls off her horse but is unharmed. Grenfell receives a note from Sir Within, who cancels their dinner plans due to a sudden gout attack, leading Grenfell to mock the old man and contemplate the advantages of being associated with Ladarelle and the future marriage to Kate O'Hara. Grenfell discusses his desire for social status and his ambition to be seen as a dominant figure in the houses he frequents, while also reflecting on his interactions with Ladarelle and his puzzlement over Kate's avoidance of him. Grenfell and Ladarelle discuss the possibility of carrying Kate off and orchestrating a sham marriage to prevent her from marrying Sir Within Wardle, with Grenfell suggesting a contact in Ireland who could help them execute the plan. Ladarelle contemplates hiring an Irish man to carry out a risky plan, while Sir Within reflects on his deteriorating health and seeks medical attention. Sir Within Wardle becomes agitated and angry when the doctor refuses to stay and care for Kate at Dalradern Castle, leading to a heated confrontation between the two. Sir Within confronts the doctor about the rumors surrounding Kate's residence at Dalradern Castle, leading to a heated argument and the doctor's hasty departure, leaving Sir Within feeling wretched and powerless; Sir Within then tries to remember what happened but cannot, and goes to check on Kate who is sleeping and having strange dreams. Sir Within introduces a doctor named Sir Henry Morland to Kate O'Hara, who is suffering from a fever, and they have a brief conversation before the doctor must leave; the doctor expresses interest in Kate and she becomes infatuated with him.

Kate, suffering from a fever, engages in a conversation with a doctor named Sir Henry Morland, expressing her desire to die and her inner turmoil, and then asks him to witness her will. Kate, suffering from a fever, gives a lock of her hair to the doctor and asks him to witness her will, while Grenfell and Ladarelle discuss their plans to prevent Kate from marrying Sir Within Wardle and consider the consequences of her death. Grenfell reads a letter from Vyner, who confesses to being ruined by a speculative venture and expresses his shock and regret, while reflecting on his naivety and the cleverness of those who took advantage of him.	987	sentence

Mr. M'Kinlay accompanies Ada to a villa in Genoa, where he is charmed by Miss Courtenay but faces disapproval when she learns of the plan to keep Kate at Dalradern Castle. Sir Gervais Vyner prepares for the arrival of his wealthy guests and decides to present Kate as his ward. Sir Within Wardle, the owner of Dalradern Castle, contemplates his social standing and the estate's financial troubles. He invites Mr. Grenfell to dinner to discuss returning the estate to Mr. Ladarelle in exchange for money. However, their negotiations become strained. Sir Within also introduces Mr. Grenfell to Kate, whose past is shrouded in mystery. Ladarelle becomes captivated by Grenfell's connections and seeks his approval. Meanwhile, Sir Within and Grenfell discuss potential marriage arrangements for Kate, and during a ride through the estate, Sir Within realizes his deepening feelings for her after she falls off her horse but is unharmed. Grenfell receives a note from Sir Within, canceling their dinner plans due to a gout attack. Grenfell contemplates the advantages of being associated with Ladarelle and the future marriage to Kate O'Hara. Grenfell and Ladarelle discuss carrying Kate off and orchestrating a sham marriage to prevent her from marrying Sir Within. Sir Within becomes agitated when the doctor refuses to care for Kate, leading to a heated confrontation. Sir Within introduces a doctor named Sir Henry Morland to Kate, who becomes infatuated with him. Kate asks the doctor to witness her will while Grenfell and Ladarelle discuss their plans to prevent her marriage to Sir Within. Vyner confesses his ruinous gambling venture to Grenfell and seeks his assistance in breaking tragic news to Luttrell. Grenfell learns of Vyner's financial ruin and plans to leave the Cottage, reflecting on the foolishness of wealth-seeking and his own dependence on Vyner's support, while also contemplating a journey to the island and discussing the collapsed house of Fletcher and David with Ladarelle. Grenfell arrives at the desolate island and searches for John Luttrell, encountering a steersman who recounts Luttrell's reclusive and hostile behavior, leading Grenfell to approach the Abbey with trepidation. Grenfell delivers the tragic news of Harry Luttrell's death to John Luttrell, who is overcome with grief and shock, and later decides to leave the island, leaving behind documents for Luttrell to read. Grenfell delivers the news of Vyner's financial ruin to Luttrell, who reflects on his own grief and resilience, and insists on telling Vyner that he is bearing the blow well; Grenfell departs, leaving Luttrell sobbing in intense grief, unsure if he should have stayed to comfort him. Kate O'Hara, now in Ostend with Sir Within Wardle, appears frail and delicate, surrounded by servants, as she and Sir Within gaze out at the sea; Kate is dressed in mourning and seems lost in her own thoughts while holding a letter. Kate and Sir Within discuss a letter from her uncle, in which he claims the right to her love and affection, offers her a home, and suggests she take on the Luttrell name, leading to a disagreement about family ties and social standing. Kate and Sir Within have a tense discussion about her uncle's poverty and her desire for affection, leading to a disagreement about her future and social standing. Kate O'Hara reflects on Sir Within Wardle's refusal to marry her due to societal pressure, expressing her hatred and desire for revenge, and contemplating leaving him to make him realize the emptiness of his life without her. Kate, having accepted her uncle's offer, writes a composed and unemotional letter to him, expressing her willingness to leave Sir Within and her desire to take on the Luttrell name, before preparing to leave for Holyhead. Kate reflects on her lost ambitions and the reversal of her fortunes as she leaves Sir Within and prepares to embark on a new chapter of her life. Kate arrives at Holyhead and awaits the arrival of her uncle, contemplating her past and uncertain future. Kate Luttrell meets with a man named Mr. Coles, who has been sent by her uncle to accompany her to Westport and then to the desolate island of Arran; they discuss her journey and the desolation of the island, with Kate expressing her desire and determination to escape from the world and embrace the solitude.	865	sentence

Kate reunites with her grandfather, attempting to bring him back to reality and discuss his impending trial. Tensions rise and secrets are revealed as Ladarelle and O'Rorke plot to prevent Sir Within's marriage. Grenfell contemplates his plans to manipulate Sir Within and the household, hoping to prevent him from marrying and instead create a lively and scandalous environment at the house. Grenfell discovers a document revealing that Kate Luttrell has married Adolphus Ladarelle, leading to Sir Within Wardle suffering a fit and Grenfell reflecting on his own culpability. Grenfell discovers evidence that Kate Luttrell's marriage to Adolphus Ladarelle is a fraud, and as he contemplates the consequences, Sir Within Wardle suffers a shock but recovers, prompting Grenfell to consider manipulating the situation to his advantage. Sir Within Wardle, weakened by illness, requests Grenfell to bring him a valuable gem as a wedding present for Kate Luttrell, but as Grenfell admires the jewels, Sir Within's health falters and he breaks down in tears; meanwhile, Kate Luttrell recovers from her illness and learns of the visit from her supposed brother and his companions, leaving her bewildered. Kate, after struggling to remember her past, finally recalls the trial and guilty verdict of her grandfather, leading her to despair and contemplate visiting him despite her weakened state. Kate learns the truth about her supposed marriage to Ladarelle, expressing her disbelief and asserting that it is not a valid union. Kate returns to Arran and rushes to her grandfather's bedside, where he is gravely ill and longing for her presence.

Sir Within Wardle and Grenfell invite M'Kinlay to dinner, where they discuss Sir Gervais's recovery and the capture of the man who ran away with his securities, leaving M'Kinlay to share the details of the story at a later time. M'Kinlay, in a long-winded explanation, reveals the intricate details of a fraudulent scheme involving Sir Gervais Vyner, the French company supplying munitions of war to the Arabs, and Mr. Gennet; Grenfell grows impatient and urges M'Kinlay to get to the point before he has to leave, prompting M'Kinlay to quickly wrap up his story and depart. Grenfell discusses with Sir Within the information he gathered from M'Kinlay, revealing a plot involving Dodge, Gennet, and the French Consul, and expressing his disdain for Vyner's involvement and his own manipulative nature. Grenfell contemplates the implications of Sir Vyner's mental decline and plans to use the opportunity to ingratiate himself with the Vyners and potentially gain favor and influence.	971	sentence

The poverty-stricken locals view them with fear and reverence, as Luttrell searches for relics and the child roams freely. Luttrell's consumptive wife dies, and he confronts Father Lowrie about his interference in their religious matters. Reluctantly, Luttrell agrees to let the priest look after his son while he isolates himself. A wealthy baronet named Vyner and his friend Grenfell arrive on a yacht, encountering the poverty of the locals and the antipathy between Grenfell and Ada's governess. Vyner explores the island and stumbles upon a passionate and eerie funeral ritual. He later discovers Luttrell and recounts his story of involvement in a secret society and his decline. Despite initial tension, Vyner attempts to befriend Luttrell's son, Harry Grenville Luttrell, feeling guilt for the wrongs done to Luttrell in the past. Vyner considers befriending Luttrell's son, Harry, despite Grenfell's warnings, and contemplates writing a note to Luttrell to invite him to dinner, while Harry reveals his father's indifference towards him. Despite Vyner's attempts to convince Harry to stay, the boy insists on going home, leading Vyner to write a note to Luttrell and express his desire to see him, while Ada and Harry bid each other farewell with sorrow and shame. Vyner is saddened by Luttrell's refusal to meet him, while Grenfell cynically analyzes Vyner's motivations and accuses him of sentimental egotism. Vyner and Grenfell discuss Luttrell's refusal to meet with Vyner, while Vyner tries to deflect Grenfell's cynicism and focuses on practical matters, such as finding timber for their boat, and a peasant misunderstands their offer of payment for a larch-tree and swims away. The locals on the island eagerly rummage through Luttrell's deceased wife's belongings, expressing gratitude and later rationalizing that he's giving away things he doesn't need, as they discuss and divide up the various items. As the locals divide up Luttrell's deceased wife's belongings, a young girl named Kitty O'Hara puts on an amber necklace and receives praise, while Vyner and his crew prepare to sail away from the island. Vyner, regretting his decision to write a note to Luttrell, explores the desolate island and attempts to signal his yacht, but encounters difficulties in being seen by the man on the shore and asks a local for help. Vyner unexpectedly meets Luttrell on the island and tries to reconnect with him, but Luttrell is ashamed of his current state and refuses to invite Vyner to his home. Vyner tries to convince Luttrell to come on board his yacht and have a conversation, but Luttrell refuses, expressing his shame and unwillingness to face Vyner's distinguished friend. Vyner and his wife have purchased a cottage in Wales that is a show place, attracting curious visitors who invade their privacy and disrupt their enjoyment of the home. Georgina Courtenay puts up a notice at the cottage, declaring that it is not open for inspection by strangers, leading to public indignation and discussions among visitors at the local inn. Mr. M'Kinlay, eager to visit the far-famed cottage of Dinasllyn, encounters a group of strangers who express their disappointment at being excluded from the cottage and demand that he deliver a message to the occupants, leading to a heated exchange and Mr. M'Kinlay's hasty departure. Mr. M'Kinlay visits Miss Courtenay and offers to help her find her niece's governess, while they engage in a conversation filled with subtle tension and veiled insults.	837	sentence

Despite initial tension, Vyner attempts to befriend Luttrell's son, Harry Grenville Luttrell, feeling guilt for the wrongs done to Luttrell in the past. Vyner, a man who desires to reconnect with Luttrell, faces rejection when Luttrell refuses to meet him. Meanwhile, Vyner's wife deals with the invasion of their privacy in their newly purchased cottage. Mr. M'Kinlay becomes entangled in the situation and offers to help Georgina find her niece's governess. Tensions rise between Mr. M'Kinlay and Georgina as they navigate their strained relationship. Ultimately, Lady Vyner plans a visit to Sir Within Wardle's castle, while Vyner continues to seek a connection with Luttrell. Sir Within Wardle, a charming but rejected man, welcomes Lady Vyner and her sister to his castle, impressing them with his lavish lifestyle. During a dinner conversation, Sir Within forgets to inform Lady Vyner about the presence of a lawyer, causing a humorous and frantic reaction. Lady Vyner and Georgina discuss Sir Within's charm and his suitability as a husband, while Mr. M'Kinlay anxiously waits for their return. Mr. M'Kinlay confronts intrusive tourists, ponders legal implications, and departs with mixed thoughts. The plot then shifts to a remote inn where Tim O'Rorke reflects on his past failures. Sir Gervais Vyner and Grenfell arrive, encountering Irish nationalism and discussing their plans. They meet a young girl named Kitty who reveals a story about a man named Luttrell and his deal with a mysterious dark man. Vyner dreams of recent events and is captivated by the fairy-like girl. Vyner, a man who once lived a life of comfort, embarks on a solitary journey to explore a desolate landscape. Along the way, he encounters various individuals who share stories of pride, poverty, and the complexities of land ownership. Despite objections from his friend Grenfell, Vyner becomes determined to educate and elevate a young Irish girl, challenging stereotypes and potentially facing unforeseen consequences. Tensions rise as discussions about negotiations, plans, and the involvement of a reclusive man unfold. Meanwhile, Luttrell, facing financial difficulties, refuses to receive a potential buyer for his collection and hesitates to send his son on a dangerous journey. Luttrell sends his son Harry on a dangerous journey by boat, while facing resistance from the locals and a looming storm. Luttrell's son, Harry, sets off on a dangerous journey by boat during a storm, causing worry and grief among those who care for him. During a severe storm, Luttrell worries about his son, Harry, who is on a dangerous journey by boat, and reflects on his own pride and past actions. As the storm subsides, Luttrell anxiously searches for any sign of his son's boat in the sea, grappling with his own pride and sense of persecution. Luttrell anxiously awaits news of his son, Harry, as a mysterious boat approaches the island, causing him great distress and fear. Luttrell's son, Harry, returns safely after a perilous boat journey, and a Yankee visitor named Mr. Dodge arrives on the island to meet Luttrell. Mr. Dodge visits Luttrell and engages in conversation about his own wealth and travels, criticizing British furniture and offering humorous observations, while Luttrell shows him some objects from his collection, including a misshapen figure believed to be an idol from Irish Paganism. Luttrell displays his collection of antiquities to the American visitor, who expresses interest in acquiring a specific item for a substantial sum of money. Luttrell is visited by an American named Mr. Dodge, who expresses interest in acquiring Luttrell's son, causing Luttrell to respond with indignation and pride. Luttrell confronts a pale, sallow-faced man named M'Kinlay, who is revealed to be a conveyancer from London with business to discuss. Mr. M'Kinlay arrives and engages in a tense conversation with Luttrell, discussing a perilous boat journey, the cruelty of an American visitor, and the purpose of M'Kinlay's visit on behalf of Sir Gervais Vyner. Luttrell listens silently as Mr. M'Kinlay explains that Sir Gervais Vyner wishes him to act as a trustee for a young girl and expresses his own self-deprecating view of his failures in life. Luttrell agrees to let Sir Gervais Vyner be the guardian of his son, Harry, after considering the potential consequences and hoping that Vyner will understand his reasons for refusing his previous request. Luttrell considers sending his son Harry away on a ship, eventually agreeing to let an American man named Mr. Dodge take him, while Luttrell reflects on the lack of opportunity on the island and the poverty of the locals, leading to a dinner in the Abbey where Luttrell apologizes for his living conditions.	952	sentence
