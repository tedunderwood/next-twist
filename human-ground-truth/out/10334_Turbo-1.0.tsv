Mr. Hickey testifies in court about his article and interview with Rupert van Slyke, revealing the threats made against him. Mr. Skoggins testifies that Mr. Chalmers had no car on the night of the murder, as it had been sold and not replaced, and Mr. Griswold provides evidence that it would have been virtually impossible for someone to travel from Mr. Chalmers' apartment to the murder scene and back in the allotted time. Mr. Katzenberger testifies about a cheque he received from Mr. Chalmers, which was later cashed without any issues. Mr. Katzenberger testifies about receiving a cheque from Mr. Chalmers on January 21st, with the signature still wet, and Mr. Norwalk, a bank-teller, confirms that the cheque is genuine. Crosby enjoys seeing Ballmeier's discomfiture as his opponent is checkmated. Archibald Chalmers' valet, Okerburg, testifies in court, recounting the events of the night of the murder, including Mr. Chalmers' actions and Mrs. Morely's presence in the adjoining room. Mrs. Morely testifies in court, providing testimony that supports Archibald Chalmers' alibi and challenges the credibility of John Carrington as a witness. In the courtroom, Ballmeier aggressively interrogates Mrs. Morely, attempting to discredit her testimony, but is ultimately unable to find any inconsistencies. During the trial, the defense attorney delivers a passionate speech against Archibald Chalmers, highlighting evidence such as the stickpin found at the murder scene and the mistaken identification of Chalmers by van Slyke's servant, Edward Venson.

Attorney Crosby questions the validity of the evidence and the motives of the witnesses. The trial is adjourned, and Chalmers urgently requests to see Crosby at the county jail. Crosby travels to Omaha for the reading of Peter Chalmers' will, which includes a condition that Archibald Chalmers must be acquitted of murder charges to inherit the estate. Crosby receives a copy of the will confirming Archibald's inheritance without conditions. Various witnesses testify in court, including Mr. Hickey about threats made against him, Mr. Skoggins about Mr. Chalmers' lack of transportation, Mr. Griswold about the impossibility of Chalmers being at the murder scene, and Mr. Katzenberger about a cheque received from Chalmers. Crosby enjoys seeing his opponent's defeat. Mrs. Morely supports Chalmers' alibi, and Crosby gives a closing speech dismissing the prosecution's evidence. The jury deliberates without reaching a verdict, leading to a mistrial and a scheduled retrial. Crosby and Chalmers discuss finding individuals to discredit the key witness, and Chalmers offers to pay for their services with his inheritance. Crosby receives a communication from Lipke that includes torn pieces of a typewritten communication from Chalmers. Curiosity gets the best of Crosby, but he ultimately seals up the torn pieces and stores them for safekeeping. Crosby meets his client Viggman, who is accused of a jewelry store robbery, and learns about the stolen Lord Masefield Octet diamonds. Viggman confesses to attorney David Crosby that he was the one who committed the St. Paul jewelry store robbery, and reveals that he still has the stolen Lord Masefield Octet. Crosby advises Viggman to offer to return the stolen gems to Rosecrantz in exchange for dropping the charges against him. Viggman agrees to help attorney David Crosby and reveals the stolen Lord Masefield Octet diamonds hidden in his hat. Crosby rents a safety-box at the bank, seals the stolen Lord Masefield Octet diamonds in a carton and locks it away, pays the rental fee, tells Viggman about the hidden diamonds, receives a telegram from Mabel Mannering requesting $44,000 in cash. Eric Worman, a bank cashier, recalls his previous actions of secretly obtaining impressions of keys and hiding packages of money in the bank's windowsills. Eric Worman, a bank cashier, duplicates keys to the safety deposit boxes and discovers valuables in one of the boxes he opens, prompting him to seal them up and leave the bank for the night.

00010334.txt	The Amazing Web	Harry Stephen Keeler	Turbo-1.0	prediction	Mrs. Hester Cornell arrives and reveals that the defense has abducted the state's chief witness, shedding light on the ongoing trial.	78691	3298	77	715	Lipke, a man looking to hire performers, interviews various potential candidates, including Carino the juggler, Professor Kanning the calculator, Manuel Gonzalez the sword-swallower, Hugo Daumstaddter the strongman, George Murphy the handcuff king, and Gus Chevalo the cyclist. Meanwhile, attorney David Crosby defends Lindell Trent, who is accused of stealing a diamond ring. Zelina Miles, the supposed victim, testifies against Lindell, but later confesses to Crosby that she framed him out of jealousy. Lindell is released from prison, changes his name to Lindey Trent, and leaves for Australia. Crosby, determined to find Lindell, meets with Enos Melford to discuss an expedition to the South Pacific. Archibald Chalmers, a London club member and resident of Chicago, is accused of murdering Rupert van Slyke. He hires attorney David Crosby and offers him a valuable yacht in exchange for legal representation. During the trial, witnesses testify about arguments and gunshots heard on the night of the murder. Attorney Crosby questions the validity of the evidence and the motives of the witnesses. The trial is adjourned, and Chalmers urgently requests to see Crosby at the county jail. Crosby travels to Omaha for the reading of Peter Chalmers' will, which includes a condition that Archibald Chalmers must be acquitted of murder charges to inherit the estate. Crosby receives a copy of the will confirming Archibald's inheritance without conditions. Various witnesses testify in court, including Mr. Hickey about threats made against him, Mr. Skoggins about Mr. Chalmers' lack of transportation, Mr. Griswold about the impossibility of Chalmers being at the murder scene, and Mr. Katzenberger about a cheque received from Chalmers. Crosby enjoys seeing his opponent's defeat. Mrs. Morely supports Chalmers' alibi, and Crosby gives a closing speech dismissing the prosecution's evidence. The jury deliberates without reaching a verdict, leading to a mistrial and a scheduled retrial. Crosby and Chalmers discuss finding individuals to discredit the key witness, and Chalmers offers to pay for their services with his inheritance. Crosby receives torn pieces of a communication from Chalmers, which he seals and stores. He meets his client Viggman, who confesses to a robbery and reveals he has stolen diamonds. Crosby advises Viggman to return the diamonds in exchange for dropped charges. Viggman agrees and reveals the diamonds hidden in his hat. Crosby rents a safety-box at the bank and locks away the diamonds. Eric Worman, a bank cashier, duplicates keys and steals money. He boards a train to Chicago with the stolen items. Anne disguises herself and participates in a job for cash. She meets a man named Mike McGann and they receive cheques that can be cashed for ten dollars each. Anne, a young woman, attempts to walk to Chicago but ends up in trouble and is arrested. In prison, she meets Viggman, who learns that a diamond dealer was shot in St. Paul, causing him to panic. They escape together, but Viggman is captured and taken to St. Paul. In court, the defense presents evidence suggesting the missing witness may have disappeared intentionally. Red Bronson testifies about Archibald Chalmers wearing a disguise and planning a burglary. Another witness describes a mysterious incident involving a struggle in a black limousine. David Crosby is arrested for possessing stolen goods and receives a letter from Chalmers, revealing his involvement in criminal activities. Crosby is confronted by Considine and Krenway, who inform him that Viggman has confessed to the theft of the diamonds Crosby had stored in a safety box, and they show him the signed confession. Crosby realizes that he had mistakenly stored cough drops instead of the diamonds, and he deduces that the bank cashier, Eric Worman, must have stolen the diamonds and fled to St. Paul. Crosby is confronted by Krenway and Considine, who accuse him of holding stolen goods and demand that he hand over the diamonds. Crosby calls Lipke to his office and demands that he give him all the details about the Carrington abduction and the Chalmers murder trial. Lipke explains his plan to David Crosby, detailing how he orchestrated the van Slyke murder and Carrington's abduction by jamming the streetcars with a circus act and employing the Bishop as a confederate. Crosby inspects the contents of the yellow slip of money, realizes it is Chalmers' money, and instructs Lipke to release Carrington and ensure his safe return.
