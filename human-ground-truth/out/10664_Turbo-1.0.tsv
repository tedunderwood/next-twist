Mason becomes intrigued by Helen's friend's interest in the ""corpus delicti."" After dismissing Helen, Mason learns that a suspicious man was following her. Mason finds a purse left behind by Helen and discovers a gun, money, and a suspicious telegram. He confronts Nell Brinley about the telegram and instructs Della Street on a plan involving Nell and Rhoda Montaine. Mason traces the telegram's sender and confronts Gregory Moxley. He later learns that the gun from Helen's purse is linked to Dr. Millsap and that Rhoda Montaine has a troubled past with Moxley. Mason questions Helen about what she's hiding and reads about Moxley's murder. A nervous man named Carl Montaine seeks Mason's help to prevent his wife from being accused of the murder. Carl Montaine seeks the help of Perry Mason after marrying Rhoda Lorton and discovering a key possibly related to a murder. Montaine recounts his suspicions about his wife's strange behavior and her connection to Doctor Millsap, sharing evidence found in her purse. Despite Montaine's desire to involve the police, Mason advises against accusing Dr. Millsap without concrete proof. Mason suggests representing Rhoda and protecting Montaine's father. As they try to evade pursuers, Mason instructs Rhoda to hide while he diverts the detectives' attention. Rhoda confesses to hitting her presumed-dead husband, Gregory, with a poker during an altercation, but claims an unknown person followed her. Mason instructs his detective to investigate the murder case, focusing on the absence of fingerprints on the doorknob. Amidst interruptions from reporters and detectives, tensions rise between Mason and the authorities. Perry Mason is determined to find Rhoda, who has been taken to an undisclosed location. He drafts a writ of habeas corpus to force the authorities to reveal her whereabouts and strategizes with Paul Drake to protect Rhoda's husband, Carl, from being manipulated by the authorities. Perry examines evidence, including the significance of a one-minute-off alarm clock and the victim being fully dressed when killed, suspecting Rhoda may be protecting someone. He confronts Doctor Millsap about his involvement and advises him to seek medical help. Perry also suspects C. Phillip Montaine, who arrives in town before the murder, of being an impostor sent to spy on him. He confronts Montaine about his motives and accuses him of spying on Rhoda, leading to a tense exchange. Perry Mason receives annulment papers for Carl Montaine's case against Rhoda Montaine. He investigates the crime scene and finds match stubs and a matchbox from the Palace Hotel. Perry instructs Otis to replace a doorbell in an apartment where a murder occurred. He discusses adverse publicity with his team and learns about Gregory Moxley's past. Perry, Paul, and Danny surveil Doris Freeman and question her about the murder. Doris accuses Rhoda but Perry dismisses her claims. C. Phillip Montaine and the district attorney try to prevent an annulment. Perry plans with Della and awaits a call from Danny. Perry and Danny go to the Greenwood Hotel, where Danny is attacked and overhears a phone conversation implicating Oscar and Doris. Perry argues with John Lucas in court and presents evidence that Rhoda's previous marriage was invalid. The judge rules in Rhoda's favor, denying the annulment. Perry Mason takes Rhoda Montaine into the jury room for consultation after winning the annulment case, and he presents her with a divorce complaint to sue her husband for extreme cruelty and false accusations of murder. Perry Mason instructs his detective, Paul Drake, to keep the suspects on the run and hounded, gathering evidence and hotel register copies, to create the impression that detectives are blundering around. Perry Mason discusses his strategy with Paul Drake, revealing his plan to implicate Oscar Pender as the guilty party by proving his suspicious behavior, such as using different aliases and fleeing from place to place.
