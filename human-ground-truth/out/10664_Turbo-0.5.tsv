At the airport, Mason warns Rhoda about the detectives searching for her and instructs her to hide in a telephone booth.

Mason also dictates a letter to the newspaper, expressing his disapproval of unfaithful husbands, while examining photographs that reveal inconsistencies in the murder scene. Perry Mason discusses the potential defense strategy with a detective, highlighting the issue of drugging the husband and the lack of fingerprints at the crime scene. Perry Mason confronts Doctor Millsap about the false burial certificate and the gun, revealing that Rhoda Montaine is under arrest for murder. Doctor Millsap reveals the details of Rhoda Montaine's life insurance policies, her marriage to Carl Montaine, and her suppressed emotional nature to Perry Mason. Doctor Millsap confesses to Perry Mason that he gave Rhoda Montaine a gun to protect herself from Gregory Moxley, but denies knowing that she was going to meet him. Perry Mason questions Millsap about his whereabouts at the time of the meeting and hints at the possibility of Millsap being involved in the murder. Perry Mason suggests to Doctor Millsap that he consult a physician to diagnose his health issues and consider going on an ocean voyage to get away from the situation. Detectives arrive at Doctor Millsap's office, and Perry Mason leaves, while the nurse sobs. Perry Mason explains to Paul Drake how the district attorney's office has trapped Rhoda Montaine into making a damaging admission, while Della Street informs Mason that C. Phillip Montaine, Rhoda's father-in-law, is waiting outside. Perry Mason discusses the possibility that the man in his outer office, C. Phillip Montaine, may have been involved in shadowing Rhoda Montaine before the murder, and suspects that he might be an impostor sent by the district attorney's office. C. Phillip Montaine offers Perry Mason a proposition, stating that he is willing to pay handsomely for Rhoda Montaine's defense, but only if Mason agrees to not fight the annulment of her marriage to Carl Montaine. Perry Mason confronts C. Phillip Montaine about his motives and accuses him of secretly spying on Rhoda Montaine. Montaine offers a proposition to pay for Rhoda's defense, but Mason refuses and declares war. Perry Mason rents an entire building and carefully examines the apartment where Gregory Moxley was murdered, comparing it to police photographs and making modifications to the electric bell. Perry Mason replaces the call bells in the apartments where Gregory Moxley was murdered with buzzers, discovers match stubs leading to the neighboring apartment, and finds a matchbox from the Palace Hotel. Perry Mason asks the electrician, Otis, to move into the apartment where a man was murdered and replace the doorbell with one from his own stock, while keeping the original bell as evidence. Perry Mason discusses the district attorney's campaign of adverse newspaper publicity against Rhoda Montaine and vows to fight back.
