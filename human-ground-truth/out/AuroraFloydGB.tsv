Aurora asks her father, Archibald Floyd, for a large sum of money without revealing her intentions, causing him distress and confusion. Aurora receives a large sum of money from her father, Mr. Floyd, and promises that it will be the last he hears of her troubles, leaving him hopeful, before they are interrupted by the arrival of a clerk with the cash, Mr. George Martin, who is dismissed after completing the transaction; Mr. Floyd then proceeds to number the notes while Aurora impatiently waits, reflecting on the difficulty she had in obtaining the money and expressing her desire for her troubles to be over.

Aurora confesses to her father that she had deceived him about her first husband's death, but assures him that she will marry John Mellish again and that they will have love, peace, and unity, while Archibald Floyd grapples with the dark mystery surrounding the trainer's death and wonders about Aurora's involvement and the fate of the money he had given her. The murder of a groom at Mellish Park has cast a dark cloud over the estate, leading John Mellish to consider fleeing with his wife, Aurora, to forget the horrific events. Speculation and malicious insinuations tarnish Aurora's reputation, while Talbot Bulstrode reflects on his past love for her. Talbot arrives at Mellish Park, concerned for Aurora's well-being and suspects foul play. John reveals his troubled state of mind and suspicions about Aurora, but Talbot defends her innocence. They confront a suspicious stranger and discover anonymous letters pointing to Aurora as the murderer. Aurora is shocked by the accusations and confronts John, who confesses his past suspicions but assures her of his love. Talbot prepares to reveal shocking information about the murder investigation. Mr. Bulstrode and John Mellish suspect that James Conyers was murdered for stolen money, leading them to question Aurora and her connection with Stephen Hargraves. Captain Prodder seeks revenge, while Hargraves contemplates leaving town. Detective Mr. Grimstone tirelessly searches for a clue, eventually finding a brass button with a potential lead. Grimstone questions the gardener, Dawson, about a waistcoat given to Hargraves, leading to a breakthrough. However, Grimstone fails to find evidence linking Hargraves to the crime or the stolen money. Hargraves mysteriously disappears, and Grimstone realizes he may have escaped on a train. John Mellish expresses his frustration and anger towards those who doubt Aurora's innocence, vowing to defend her honor and confront anyone who dares to insinuate against her, while Talbot Bulstrode observes his friend's emotional outburst. John Mellish anxiously waits for news from the detective about the murder investigation, while Talbot Bulstrode tries to comfort and reassure him, reminding him of the importance of Aurora's presence in dispelling suspicions against her. John Mellish expresses his unwavering belief in his wife's innocence, vowing to protect her reputation against the suspicions and malicious insinuations of others, while Talbot Bulstrode grapples with his own agony over the tarnished name he loves. Talbot Bulstrode rides to Doncaster to find detective Mr. Grimstone, who has made no progress in the murder investigation and offers no new information to Talbot. Talbot Bulstrode returns to Mellish Park and notices a flickering light in the window of the lodge where the murder took place, prompting him to investigate further. Talbot Bulstrode discovers the hump-backed man, Stephen Hargraves, lurking at the lodge and confronts him about his presence and the bundle he is carrying. Talbot Bulstrode confronts Stephen Hargraves about the waistcoat, leading to a physical struggle in which Bulstrode is overpowered, but just as Hargraves is about to harm him, Samuel Prodder intervenes and subdues Hargraves, allowing Bulstrode to continue his search for the waistcoat. Talbot Bulstrode finds the waistcoat and pocket-book containing the stolen money in Stephen Hargraves' possession and calls for witnesses, leading to Hargraves' confession of the murder and his plans to flee.	344	EOF

Aurora falls ill but recovers and eventually marries John. Talbot still harbors feelings for Aurora, but she and John devise a plan to marry him to Aurora's cousin Lucy. Aurora's mysterious behavior raises concerns, and tensions rise when James Conyers, a morally questionable man, is found dead in the woods. The constable investigates, revealing evidence of Conyers' presence and a gunshot wound in his back. After the trainer's death, the constable discovers a bloodstained paper sewn into the lining of the waistcoat, which he plans to show to the coroner, while the villagers are consumed by curiosity about the murder and the suspected murderer. John Mellish is consumed with the horror of the murder and the disappearance of Samuel Prodder, but remains steadfast in his belief in his wife's innocence. Aurora's husband, John Mellish, returns home and is confronted by his wife, who is aware of the trainer's death and expresses her readiness to hear the details, while Mrs. Powell speculates about Aurora's involvement and suggests she may need to appear at the inquest, prompting John to vehemently defend his wife's innocence. Aurora assures her husband that she will tell the truth about the gunshot she heard if called as a witness, and they discuss their feelings about the recent events and Mrs. Powell's presence, ultimately reflecting on the happiness they once had in their home. John Mellish reflects on his past and feels unworthy of the happiness he has had, contemplating the selflessness of others as the investigation into the murder continues. The constable informs John Mellish that he will need to appear as a witness at the inquest, while Aurora remains in a state of despair and illness, and John contemplates taking her away to start anew once the investigation is over. John Mellish refuses to believe any ill of his wife, Aurora, and remains steadfast in his love for her despite mounting evidence against her, as he attends the inquest into the death of James Conyers, where little new information is revealed. John Mellish defends the innocence of his wife, Aurora, and reflects on the ongoing investigation into the murder, while encountering the ""Softy"" who calls out to him. John Mellish is summoned by the coroner and clergyman, who reveal to him a blood-stained paper found in the waistcoat of the deceased, which they have partially deciphered and consider to be of importance. John Mellish is distraught when he discovers a blood-stained document that reveals Aurora believed James Conyers, who she was engaged to before marrying John, to be dead when they got married. John Mellish reflects on his past and feels a sense of disconnection from his former self, while holding a blood-stained document that reveals Aurora believed her previous fiancé, James Conyers, to be dead when they got married, and Aurora waits anxiously for John's return from the inquest. Aurora sits alone, tormented by anxiety and the fear of the truth being revealed at the inquest, while reflecting on her love for both her husband and her father."	909	sentence

Aurora, overwhelmed by shame and guilt, decides to leave her husband John Mellish forever, while John pities and forgives her, vowing to protect her from the world's judgment and shield her with his love. John Mellish yearns for a peaceful place where he and Aurora can escape judgment and live in adoration, unaware of the secrets that Aurora is hiding and the schemes of Mrs. Powell, who plans to exploit their vulnerabilities for her own gain. Aurora, filled with guilt and shame, contemplates leaving her husband John Mellish forever, fearing his resentment and the judgment of society, while John remains devoted to her and vows to protect her despite his own doubts and the schemes of others. Aurora, seeking guidance and comfort, travels to London to seek the advice of Talbot Bulstrode, whom she respects and trusts, while reflecting on her past decisions and the sacrifices she has made in her relationships. Talbot Bulstrode, concerned for Aurora's well-being, urges John Mellish to come to Halfmoon Street. Aurora seeks Talbot's advice and decides to follow his guidance, leading to a heartfelt reunion with John. They plan to tell Archibald Floyd the truth about the trainer's death and their past secrets. John and Aurora reflect on their troubled past and discuss their plans for a fresh start. They arrive in London, unaware of the significance of an encounter with a man inquiring about John. Talbot and John obtain approval for their marriage and proceed to a hidden church for the wedding ceremony. They then return to Doncaster to address any possible disturbances related to the murder. Captain Prodder, tormented by fear and curiosity, returns to Doncaster and contemplates the murder investigation. The landlord and two men discuss a newspaper article criticizing the investigation into the murder, and a man in a velveteen coat reveals that he knew the victim, Jim Conyers, and hints at having some peculiar knowledge about him. Samuel Prodder listens to a conversation between Mr. Harrison, the dog-fancier, and the ""Softy,"" Steve Hargraves, who hints at having knowledge about the murder of James Conyers and the woman involved. In a conversation with other men, Stephen Hargraves hints at the involvement of a woman, the daughter of Mr. Floyd, who was married to the squire while her first husband was alive and wrote a letter to the murdered man asking to meet him on the night of the crime, causing Captain Prodder to react in anger. Captain Prodder confronts the ""Softy"" and nearly attacks him when he produces a letter written by Aurora to James Conyers, causing the captain to question its authenticity and contemplate the implications of this evidence. John Mellish and his wife Aurora, still haunted by the recent murder and funeral of the trainer, discuss plans to leave Mellish Park, rebuild the lodge, and start fresh in the south of France, while Aurora is tormented by the memory of the death and the guilt of her past actions. The servants at Mellish Park discuss the murder and the sudden flight of Mrs. Mellish, speculating on her involvement and questioning the strange coincidences surrounding her presence at the park on the night of the murder and her departure on the day of the inquest. Aurora, overwhelmed by guilt and haunted by the presence of the murdered man, feels oppressed in her own home and fears the consequences of her past actions being exposed, while John worries about her well-being and contemplates the possibility of further disturbances related to the murder investigation. As Talbot Bulstrode reads the newspaper behind a screen, he reflects on his past love for Aurora, feeling remorse for how he treated her and realizing the depth of her pain, while still remaining devoted to his wife Lucy. Talbot Bulstrode arrives at Mellish Park and notices the change in Aurora's appearance, leading him to suspect that she may have heard about the murder or have reason to believe she is in trouble; he goes in search of John Mellish for answers. John Mellish, haunted by a secret, appears haggard and distant, causing Talbot Bulstrode to confront him in an attempt to offer help and support."	961	sentence

As the detective investigates the murder, he discovers a brass button that may be linked to the missing pistol and offers a reward for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer, while Captain Prodder learns more about James Conyers and Stephen Hargraves remains in the area, seemingly reluctant to find a new job. Stephen Hargraves, known as the ""Softy,"" plans to leave Mellish Park and takes a train to Liverpool, while detective Joseph Grimstone continues his investigation, searching for a specific type of button linked to the murder, and discovers a pawnbroker's shop that may hold clues. After a day of investigation, detective Joseph Grimstone discovers waistcoats with brass buttons that may be linked to the murder, and shares his findings with John Mellish and Talbot Bulstrode, giving them hope that they are getting closer to uncovering the truth. The detective questions the gardener, Dawson, about a waistcoat he had given to Stephen Hargraves, revealing a potential connection between Hargraves and the murder. After gathering evidence and interrogating witnesses, detective Joseph Grimstone investigates Stephen Hargraves, the ""Softy,"" in connection with the murder, but despite his efforts, he is unable to find any concrete proof linking Hargraves to the crime."	961	sentence
