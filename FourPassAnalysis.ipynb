    "### Key chunking functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function here divides a novel into sentences, marking the location of \"divides\" both between sentences and between chapters. It's assisted by a function that fuses short sentences (fewer than five words), and breaks very long ones (more than 200 words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then ```get_bookruns``` uses that data to construct a sequence of four passes through the novel that should hit all (or nearly all) the chapter breaks without greatly distorting chunk length. We do this by making four different passes at 900-word intervals, with a 250-word offset between each pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to break at sentences, the chunks are never *exactly* 900 words long. Moreover, we align chunks with chapter breaks when the chapter break is sufficiently close (within 130 words of the \"ideal\" 900-word rhythm). We allow stochastic variation for the other chunks as well, so the chunks on either side of a chapter break are not much more disparate in length than the average pair of chunks."
