The Musgroves inform Anne that Captain Wentworth, whom her family is eagerly discussing, is expected to visit and they plan to seek his acquaintance. Captain Wentworth's visit to the Musgroves is delayed due to a child's injury, but the Musgroves and Anne eagerly anticipate his arrival and express their admiration for him. Mary decides to go with Charles to dine at the other house, leaving Anne alone with the sick child, despite Anne's reassurances that she can handle it and that it is not uncommon for husbands to be less involved in nursing. Anne is left alone to care for the sick child while her brother and sister go to meet Captain Wentworth, and though she initially feels comforted, she later realizes that Captain Wentworth had intentionally avoided seeing her.

Anne, another daughter, convinces them to move to Bath and keep the letting of their house a secret. They discuss potential tenants, including Admiral Croft and his wife, while Anne hopes for a reunion with Captain Wentworth. Lady Russell is concerned about the growing intimacy between Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay. Elizabeth and Sir Walter leave for Bath, while Anne stays at Uppercross Cottage. Mary and Anne visit the Musgroves, where they observe the dynamics and concerns of the family. Anne, who has feelings for Captain Wentworth, learns that he will be visiting the Crofts. However, their plans to meet are interrupted by a child's accident. Captain Wentworth returns to the area, causing excitement for the Musgroves, but Anne overhears a conversation that suggests he is no longer interested in her. They have no interaction, and their past connection now brings pain and distance. Captain Wentworth's indifference becomes apparent, while Anne reflects on his potential fortune and future prospects. Mary disapproves of Henrietta potentially marrying Charles Hayter, while Anne reflects on Captain Wentworth's preferences and the consequences of his actions. Captain Wentworth unexpectedly visits Anne, but their interaction is disrupted by Charles Hayter and a mischievous child. Anne longs for a conversation that never happens. Anne overhears Captain Wentworth and Louisa discussing Mary's influence and his regret over her refusal of Charles's proposal. Captain Wentworth's actions towards Anne leave her deeply affected. The group arrives in Lyme, where Anne engages in conversations with Captain Benwick and catches the eye of a gentleman. Louisa's accident causes distress, and Captain Wentworth stays with her while Anne goes to Uppercross. Captain Wentworth demonstrates his friendship towards Anne by suggesting a plan for breaking the news to the Musgroves. Anne helps care for Louisa and plans a trip to Lyme with the Musgroves to support her recovery, reflecting on her changed priorities and hopes for a future with Captain Wentworth.

Anne unexpectedly encounters Captain Wentworth in Bath, leading to an awkward conversation where he reveals Louisa's engagement. Anne attends a concert hoping to see Captain Wentworth, but instead engages with Mr. Elliot and later spots Captain Wentworth avoiding her gaze, leaving her uncertain about his intentions. Anne visits Mrs. Smith, who mistakenly believes that Anne is in a romantic relationship with Mr. Elliot and asks for her help in influencing him. Anne denies any romantic involvement and expresses confusion over Mrs. Smith's assumptions. Mrs. Smith reveals to Anne that Mr. Elliot is a heartless and selfish man, sharing her personal experiences with him. She shows Anne a letter from Mr. Elliot to her late husband, confirming his motive for marrying for money. Anne learns about Mr. Elliot's true motives, including his desire to secure his inheritance and regain favor with the family. Determined to distance herself from him, Anne plans to inform Lady Russell of the deception. Anne is surprised by the unexpected arrival of Charles and Mary Musgrove in Bath and attends a gathering with them, where she overhears rumors about her and Mr. Elliot. While discussing plans for a play, Anne's heart is stirred when Captain Wentworth pays close attention to her and makes a remark about the passage of time, but their interaction is interrupted by the arrival of Anne's father and sister, causing the atmosphere to turn cold and formal. Anne anxiously observes Captain Wentworth's reaction to Elizabeth's invitation, interpreting his expression as disdain and feeling uncertain about his intentions. Anne arrives late to a gathering with the Musgroves, where she overhears Mrs. Musgrove discussing the engagement of her daughter and feels a nervous thrill when Captain Wentworth pauses and gives her a quick, conscious look. Captain Harville and Anne engage in a conversation about the nature of men's and women's feelings and attachments, with Captain Wentworth listening nearby.

Anne receives a letter from Captain Wentworth expressing his love and desire to be with her, but her joy is interrupted by the arrival of her family, forcing her to hide her emotions and leave abruptly. Anne and Captain Wentworth unexpectedly meet in Bath, and Charles asks Captain Wentworth to escort Anne home, leading to a joyful reunion and a conversation about their past misunderstandings. After realizing his love for Anne, Captain Wentworth reflects on his past mistakes and regrets, feeling remorse for his pride and resentment, and decides to leave Lyme and wait for Louisa's recovery elsewhere. Anne and Captain Wentworth have a heartfelt conversation, where Anne explains her reasons for yielding to persuasion in the past and Captain Wentworth reflects on his own feelings and regrets, leading to a joyful reunion and a hopeful future.
