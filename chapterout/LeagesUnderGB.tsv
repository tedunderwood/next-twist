The narrator alerts Captain Nemo to the approaching hostile natives, and despite the potential danger, Captain Nemo remains calm and indifferent, deciding to allow them to board the Nautilus without causing harm to any of them, and later discusses the adventures of Captain Dumont d'Urville and his own experiences navigating the seas. The Nautilus successfully escapes from the hostile natives by using its electrified railing, and the narrator marvels at the ship's speed and the protection it offers against outside attack as they continue their underwater journey, passing through various locations and encountering new wonders of the ocean. Captain Nemo conducts experiments on the temperature and density of the sea, revealing his vast knowledge and expertise, leading the narrator to suspect that they may soon return to more populated areas. The Nautilus drifts into a brilliant tide of phosphorescent strata, filled with luminous animals and marine creatures, captivating the narrator and his companions as they observe the wonders of the underwater world. The narrator and his companions are confined to a cell by Captain Nemo after he experiences a sudden burst of anger, and they are then drugged and fall into a deep sleep. The narrator is awakened from a deep sleep and finds himself free on the Nautilus, where he is asked by Captain Nemo to attend to a wounded crew member with a severe head injury, though the captain remains evasive about how the injury occurred.	907	sentence

Accompanied by his loyal companion Conseil and skeptical harpooner Ned Land, they encounter a powerful narwhal and are thrown overboard. They are rescued and discover they are on a massive steel narwhal, the Nautilus. Captured by its enigmatic commander, Captain Nemo, they explore the advanced technology and capabilities of the Nautilus. They embark on underwater journeys, witnessing marine life and shipwrecks, and facing challenges along the way. The Nautilus eventually enters the Red Sea and Mediterranean, and the narrator contemplates escaping but witnesses underwater volcanic eruptions and observes various fish species. Captain Nemo reveals his mission to collect treasure for humanity and takes the narrator on a unique underwater excursion. The narrator and Captain Nemo embark on a journey through an underwater world, encountering incredible geological formations, unique marine life, and the ruins of an ancient civilization. The narrator is fascinated by the discoveries but struggles to communicate with Captain Nemo. They stumble upon evidence of Atlantis and explore its plains before reaching the heart of an extinct volcano, which serves as the Nautilus' refuge. They encounter vegetation and marine life inside the volcano but are forced to flee when the rising tide threatens to trap them. They continue their voyage through the Sargasso Sea, encounter a whaling vessel, and witness a battle between sperm whales and baleen whales. The narrator observes the wonders of the deep sea before the Nautilus resurfaces. Throughout their journey, tensions arise between the crew members regarding the morality of their actions. The Nautilus navigates through treacherous ice fields in the Antarctic, with Captain Nemo skillfully maneuvering the ship and splitting the ice with great force. The Nautilus battles against treacherous ice fields in the Antarctic, but ultimately becomes immobilized, prompting the narrator to question Captain Nemo's decision-making. Captain Nemo reveals his plan to take the Nautilus to the South Pole, despite being trapped in the ice, and the narrator becomes excited about the possibility, discussing the potential obstacles and the Nautilus' capabilities to navigate through the ice and reach the pole. Captain Nemo and the narrator plan to push on to the South Pole, but encounter thick ice that prevents their progress. The narrator and Captain Nemo reach the open sea and possibly the South Pole, where they explore an islet and observe the volcanic and desolate landscape of Antarctica. The narrator describes the diverse flora and fauna of the Antarctic region, including microscopic buds, diatoms, fucus plants, sea butterflies, coral, starfish, birds, penguins, and various fish species, as they navigate through a blizzard and hope for clear skies to determine if they have reached the South Pole. Upon reaching the Antarctic, the narrator and Conseil explore a bay filled with seals and walruses, observing their behavior and discussing their characteristics, while lamenting the senseless hunting that threatens their existence. The narrator and Captain Nemo eagerly await the appearance of the sun to determine their position at the South Pole, and while the narrator collects an auk's egg, Captain Nemo explains his plan to use his chronometer to measure the sun's altitude and confirm their location. Captain Nemo and the narrator reach the summit of a peak in Antarctica, where they observe the sun sinking below the horizon and determine that they have reached the South Pole. Captain Nemo claims the South Pole as his own and unfurls a black flag with a gold ""N,"" but soon after, the Nautilus goes aground and lists to its side, leaving the crew uncertain of their current location and situation. The Nautilus runs aground in an accident caused by a block of ice, leaving the crew trapped in a tunnel of ice but with a potential escape route. The narrator and his companions, trapped inside the Nautilus, admire the dazzling beauty of the ice walls before the submarine speeds up and they are forced to shield their eyes; they later discover that their path is blocked and they are boxed in. The crew of the Nautilus find themselves trapped under impenetrable frozen walls of ice and face the threat of death by asphyxiation, prompting Captain Nemo to devise a plan to cut through the ice and free the submarine before their air supply runs out."	938	sentence

Captain Nemo lectures Ned Land on the ethics of hunting whales, while the Nautilus engages in a fierce battle with a herd of sperm whales, using its steel spur to skewer and kill them one by one. The Nautilus surfaces after a battle with sperm whales, revealing a sea covered in mutilated corpses, leading to a debate between Captain Nemo and Ned Land about hunting ethics; later, the Nautilus encounters floating icebergs in the polar seas. The Nautilus navigates through treacherous ice fields in the Antarctic, using its powerful force to carve a path and withstand violent squalls, while the protagonist marvels at the stunning and ever-changing scenery. The protagonist and their companions find themselves trapped in the Antarctic ice, with Captain Nemo revealing his plan to take the Nautilus to the South Pole, a seemingly impossible and insane undertaking. The protagonist and Captain Nemo discuss their plan to navigate under the solidified ice of the South Pole, using the Nautilus's capabilities to break through and explore the potential open sea beneath. The Nautilus successfully breaks through the ice and emerges into open water, reaching the surface of the ocean in their quest to navigate to the South Pole. The protagonist and the crew of the Nautilus reach the South Pole, where they encounter an open sea, explore the desolate landscape, and observe limited vegetation and abundant bird life. The protagonist and Conseil observe various Antarctic birds and marine life, including sheathbills, albatross, petrels, and penguins, while Captain Nemo expresses frustration at the absence of the sun and the mist turning into snow. The protagonist and Conseil observe seals and walruses in a bay, marveling at their appearance and discussing their characteristics, before deciding to return to the Nautilus.	945	sentence

Captain Nemo takes the protagonist to the wreckage of a ship called the Avenger, which sank after a heroic battle seventy-four years ago, and the protagonist begins to see a distinction between the man and the scientist in Captain Nemo. The protagonist and their companions spot a warship approaching the Nautilus, hoping for rescue, but soon realize that the ship is firing at them, indicating that the nations have discovered the Nautilus's true nature and are now hunting Captain Nemo as a man seeking vengeance. Captain Nemo and the protagonist's companions witness a battle between the Nautilus and a warship, with Captain Nemo revealing his intent to sink the ship as an act of revenge, while the protagonist plans an escape. The protagonist watches in horror as the Nautilus collides with and sinks a warship, witnessing the crew's desperate struggle for survival. The protagonist wakes up to find Ned Land telling them that they will escape from the Nautilus that night. The protagonist prepares to escape the Nautilus, fearing an encounter with Captain Nemo, and anxiously awaits the appointed time to meet Ned Land and Conseil. The protagonist, Ned Land, and Conseil attempt to escape the Nautilus as it is caught in a dangerous whirlpool called the Maelstrom, but their skiff is ripped away and they lose consciousness.	451	EOF
