Dr. Mortimer seeks Holmes' advice on whether it is safe to bring Sir Henry Baskerville, the heir to the Baskerville estate, to Dartmoor. Holmes analyzes a mysterious message sent to Sir Henry Baskerville and deduces that it was written by an educated person posing as uneducated. Despite the danger, Sir Henry insists on going to Baskerville Hall and invites Holmes and Watson to join him. As they investigate, they realize that there are people with ulterior motives who are interested in Sir Henry. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigate the mysterious case of Sir Henry Baskerville's missing boot and the death of his uncle. Holmes advises Sir Henry to bring a companion to Devonshire, and Watson joins him while Holmes handles a blackmailer scandal in London. As they delve into the Baskerville case, Holmes and Watson receive telegrams and interview a cabman who reveals that their suspect is Holmes himself. They journey to Devonshire, where they encounter a convict, observe the desolate moor, and arrive at Baskerville Hall. Strange occurrences and warnings about the dangers of the moor lead them to suspect foul play, and Miss Stapleton's evasive behavior raises concerns for Sir Henry's safety. While the escaped convict remains at large and the Stapletons' safety is a concern, Sir Henry becomes increasingly interested in Miss Stapleton, causing tension with her brother. Watson discovers suspicious behavior by Barrymore, raising questions about his involvement in the mysterious events at Baskerville Hall. Watson follows Sir Henry onto the moor against Holmes' advice and witnesses a heated encounter between Sir Henry and Miss Stapleton. Sir Henry proposes to Miss Stapleton, but their conversation is interrupted by Stapleton's brother, leading to a confrontation. Holmes and Watson catch Barrymore in a conspiracy and discover that Mrs. Barrymore's brother, an escaped convict, has been hiding on the moor. Watson and Sir Henry pursue the convict on the moor, witnessing mysterious figures and contemplating the need for answers. Barrymore reveals that Sir Charles Baskerville was meeting a woman with the initials L.L., prompting Watson and Sir Henry to search for her. Watson learns about a woman named Laura Lyons who has connections to Stapleton and Sir Charles Baskerville. He plans to visit her in Coombe Tracey for more information. During their conversation, Mrs. Lyons admits to writing a letter to Sir Charles, but denies keeping the appointment in the letter. Watson also encounters an old man who may have information about the mysterious events. Watson searches for the mysterious man and finds evidence of recent occupation. Holmes reveals that Stapleton is married to the woman posing as his sister and that she is important to their investigation. Holmes and Watson discover a murder on the moor and later find the body of Sir Henry Baskerville, killed by the hound. They also find the body of the escaped convict, Selden. Stapleton encounters Holmes and Watson and suggests covering up Selden's body. Holmes plans to capture Stapleton and believes he is a Baskerville. Holmes and Watson make plans to deceive the Stapletons by sending a telegram, then visit Mrs. Laura Lyons and confront her about her connection to the case, revealing that Stapleton is actually married to her and has been deceiving her. As Holmes and Watson prepare for their final effort on the moor, they discuss their plans with Mrs. Lyons, and Holmes cryptically hints at the impending resolution of the case before they head to Dartmoor. Holmes and Watson wait in ambush, observing Sir Henry and Stapleton through a window, but become increasingly concerned as a dense fog rolls in, potentially obstructing their plans. Holmes and Watson, waiting in ambush, witness the arrival of the man they were awaiting on the moor, only to be confronted by a monstrous black hound with flaming eyes and a fiery mouth, which they manage to kill to save Sir Henry's life. After witnessing the death of the monstrous black hound, Holmes and Watson search for their suspect, only to find Mrs. Stapleton tied up in a room filled with a collection of butterflies and moths, revealing her husband's cruel treatment and deception. After the fog lifts, Holmes and Watson return to Baskerville Hall with Sir Henry, who falls ill with a fever, and they later discover Mrs. Stapleton tied up in a room filled with butterflies and moths, revealing her husband's cruelty and deception. Holmes and Watson discuss the Baskerville mystery, with Holmes revealing the true identity and background of Stapleton, who was actually a Baskerville descendant and had changed his name after committing crimes in South America. Stapleton's sinister plot is revealed as Holmes explains how he used his wife as a decoy, acquired a savage hound, and orchestrated the death of Sir Charles Baskerville to inherit the estate.	982	sentence

The sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville raises suspicion, and Dr. Mortimer confides in Holmes about the strange fears and beliefs of Sir Charles, leading Holmes to become intrigued by the case. Dr. Mortimer seeks Holmes' advice on what to do with Sir Henry Baskerville, the heir to the Baskerville estate. Holmes and Watson analyze footprints and examine a mysterious letter, deducing its origin and discussing the missing boot of Sir Henry Baskerville. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are asked by Sir Henry Baskerville to accompany him to Baskerville Hall in Devonshire. Holmes devises a plan to search for a missing newspaper page while receiving surprising news from a cabman. They discuss potential suspects and warn Sir Henry about the dangers he may face. Arriving at Baskerville Hall, they encounter a soldier on watch for an escaped convict and the atmosphere becomes increasingly eerie. They have a gloomy dinner, hear a woman sobbing at night, and investigate the strange occurrence with Barrymore. Watson encounters a stranger named Stapleton who reveals himself to be a naturalist and discusses the legend of the hound. Stapleton warns Watson about the dangers of the Grimpen Mire and the mysterious sounds of the moor, while revealing his own ability to navigate the treacherous landscape and his fascination with the rare plants and butterflies that reside there. Miss Stapleton urgently warns Watson to leave the moor, revealing her beauty and her brother's unusual behavior. Watson visits Miss Stapleton, who apologizes for mistaking him for Sir Henry and warns him about the dangers of the moor, but refuses to provide more specific information. Dr. Watson writes a letter to Sherlock Holmes, describing the eerie atmosphere of the moor and the presence of prehistoric structures, while mentioning the escaped convict and expressing concern for the Stapletons, particularly Miss Stapleton's fascination with Sir Henry Baskerville. Holmes and Watson investigate the mysterious events, observe Barrymore's suspicious behavior, witness Sir Henry meeting with Miss Stapleton, and ultimately uncover the truth about Barrymore's involvement with the escaped convict. They set out to capture the convict but are interrupted by a chilling cry of a hound, leaving them shaken and fearful. Watson suspects a supernatural hound and a stranger following them, keeping his plans secret from Sir Henry. Barrymore confesses that Sir Charles Baskerville was meeting a woman with the initials L.L., prompting them to inform Holmes. Watson learns about a woman named Laura Lyons and plans to gather information from her. Watson meets Mrs. Lyons, questions her about her correspondence with Sir Charles, and discovers a potential lead from Mr. Frankland. Watson investigates a stone hut, where Holmes reveals himself. Holmes reveals Stapleton's wife and they hear a scream, finding Sir Henry dead. Holmes suspects Stapleton and discusses involving Mrs. Lyons. Sherlock Holmes and Sir Henry Baskerville discuss recent events and Holmes expresses his admiration for a series of portraits on the wall. Holmes and Watson discuss the family portraits at Baskerville Hall, and Holmes identifies a portrait of Hugo Baskerville as the cause of the hound's curse, leading them to suspect Stapleton and plan their next moves. After devising a plan to deceive Sir Henry Baskerville and ensure their presence when needed, Holmes and Watson head to London, receiving a telegram from Lestrade and making arrangements to visit Mrs. Laura Lyons, where Holmes confronts her about her connection to the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the true identity of Mr. Stapleton's supposed sister. Sherlock Holmes confronts Mrs. Lyons about her involvement in the death of Sir Charles Baskerville, revealing her connection to Stapleton and her role in sending a letter to Sir Charles, while Holmes expresses confidence in solving the case soon. Holmes and Watson, along with Lestrade, arrive at Merripit House on the moor, where they set up an ambush and observe Sir Henry and Stapleton conversing inside, until Stapleton leaves briefly and returns with a curious scuffling noise from an out-house. Holmes and Watson wait in anticipation for their target to appear, but as a dense fog rolls in, they are suddenly confronted by a monstrous, fire-breathing black hound that chases their friend Sir Henry Baskerville. After a fierce chase, Holmes and Watson manage to kill the monstrous hound attacking Sir Henry Baskerville, only to discover a shocking and unexpected sight in a locked room: Mrs. Stapleton, bound and gagged, revealing the true identity and twisted nature of her husband. After capturing the hound and discovering Mrs. Stapleton bound and bruised, Holmes and Watson follow her guidance through the treacherous bog to find Sir Henry's missing boot, confirming Stapleton's involvement in the plot. After the chase, Holmes and Watson discover Stapleton's body buried in the Grimpen Mire, along with evidence of his hideout and the hound; Holmes concludes that Stapleton's plan was to use the hound to frighten Sir Charles to death and that they have solved the case. Holmes explains to Watson the true identity of the culprit, Stapleton, and reveals the elaborate plan he devised to inherit the Baskerville estate, including using a savage hound and posing his wife as his sister.	996	sentence
