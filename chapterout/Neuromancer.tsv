Case successfully infiltrates the Sense/Net building with Molly's assistance, using his program to bypass security and trigger a diversion created by the Panther Moderns, causing chaos and confusion among the employees as they are exposed to misinformation and disturbing imagery. Case triggers a diversion at Sense/Net, successfully infiltrates the building with Molly's help, and navigates through the matrix to reach the location of the Dixie Flatline's construct. Case and Molly successfully steal the construct from the library, triggering chaos and confusion at Sense/Net, but encounter a panicked crowd and a group of Panther Moderns before meeting Lupus Yonderboy, the leader of the Panther Moderns, who criticizes Armitage for losing control. Case receives a mysterious message from Wintermute through Lupus Yonderboy, and later meets with Molly and the Finn to discuss their next move, all while navigating the gritty and ever-changing world of Chiba. Case helps the Finn with a door panel, and they discuss an AI called Wintermute that may be backing Armitage, revealing a story about a stolen computer terminal that leads to the Tessier-Ashpool clan. The Finn reveals information about Tessier-Ashpool, a secretive and powerful family, and gives Case coordinates and entry codes for a separate job in London, while Case contemplates the Flatline's construct and encounters a provocative ad for Freeside. Case reminisces about the Flatline and connects with the construct, Dix, to plan their next move, accessing a pirate's paradise in Copenhagen and then connecting to the London data base to uncover information about Armitage and Colonel Willis Corto. Case, hungover and confused, reflects on the story of Colonel Corto, a soldier who was betrayed and left blind and legless after a failed mission, and receives a call from Armitage informing him that they are going to Istanbul.	894	sentence
