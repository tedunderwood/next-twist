He interviews various individuals with unique talents, ultimately selecting a cyclist with a double loopless loop-the-loop act. Meanwhile, in Kansas, young attorney David Crosby tries to convince Lindell Trent to plead guilty in her grand larceny trial. Lindell is found guilty, but on her deathbed, Zelina Miles confesses to framing Lindell and reveals her innocence. David, feeling guilty, travels to the State Penitentiary to rectify the injustice, only to discover that Lindell has been pardoned. He receives a letter and a postcard photograph revealing Lindell's current whereabouts. Lindell Trent, now in San Francisco under a new name, plans to start a new life in Australia and expresses disappointment in David Crosby. Meanwhile, David Crosby visits Mr. Melford to inquire about the cost of an expedition to search for skeletons and jewelry on uninhabited islands in the South Pacific. Enos Melford reads a newspaper clipping about two men stranded on a volcanic island, one of whom was a criminal named Cape Town Eddy Courney. David Crosby, unable to find Lindell Trent, discusses his plan to search for her by locating a meshbag with her name and address engraved on it on a volcanic island. Archibald Chalmers is summoned to police headquarters in Chicago and accused of murder. He asks Mr. Melford to find him a lawyer and is introduced to David Crosby. Crosby accepts Chalmers' offer to represent him in exchange for the use of his yacht. During the trial, Crosby challenges the prosecution's claim. During Archibald Chalmers' murder trial, his defense attorney David Crosby cross-examines multiple witnesses, including Mrs. Maude Ganniston and Jerry Noonan, raising doubts about their testimonies and the credibility of evidence such as a stickpin and a threatening letter. Crosby's focus then shifts to Edward Venson, George Krenway, and John Carrington, challenging their identifications and testimonies. Despite his efforts, Crosby fails to break down Carrington's testimony, and the trial becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Chalmers must secure an acquittal to inherit a half-million-dollar estate. Throughout the trial, Crosby receives support from Chalmers, who is in jail, and they discuss the challenges they face, including the testimony of key witnesses and handwriting evidence. During Archibald Chalmers' murder trial, David Crosby, the defense attorney, cross-examines witnesses and presents evidence that challenges the prosecution's case and raises doubts about the timeline of events and Chalmers' involvement. He also introduces witnesses, including Oscar Okerburg and Mrs. Morely, to provide an alibi for Chalmers. Throughout the trial, Crosby delivers passionate closing arguments, challenging the credibility of witnesses and evidence. After the jury fails to reach a verdict, Chalmers and Crosby discuss locating individuals who could discredit a key witness. Meanwhile, Crosby also takes on another case involving a jewelry heist and advises his client on legal options. David Crosby confronts Viggman, a criminal, and proposes to help him escape legal trouble in exchange for returning the stolen diamonds, revealing Viggman's hidden loot in the process. David Crosby secures a set of valuable diamonds from Viggman, places them in a safety box, and plans to report that prosecution is waived in Viggman's case, all while preparing for a train journey to St. Paul. Crosby safely locks away the Lord Masefield Octet in a bank safety box before receiving a telegram instructing him to arrange for $44,000 in cash by Friday morning, causing him to change his plans and head to Omaha instead of St. Paul. Eric Worman, a cunning bank employee, carefully executes a plan to steal money from the bank's safety deposit boxes using stolen keys and marked packages of money. Eric Worman successfully steals valuable gems from safety deposit boxes at the bank and conceals them in a box of coughdrops, replacing it in the vault before leaving town with his belongings. Eric carefully conceals stolen money in his suitcase, boards a train to St. Paul, and then disembarks at Mormon Junction to escape with the money into the darkness.	923	sentence
